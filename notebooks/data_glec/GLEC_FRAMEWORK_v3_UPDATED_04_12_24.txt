Foreword

Freight transportation and logistics activities 
currently contribute 8% of global greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, and demand for freight transport is 
expected to roughly double by 2050, according to the 
International Transport Forum.1 To meet the Climate 
Targets of the United Nations’ Paris Agreement, it is 
crucial to improve the efficiency of freight transport 
and reduce transport-related emissions. A concerted 
global effort is necessary to achieve goals. The 
GLEC Framework v3 supports you in your efforts 
and contribution to reaching these goals.

Introduction
Global Logistics 
Emissions Council

The next few years are decisive in this regard. 
Failure to reach climate targets could have 
massive economic impacts, and the expected 
cost of an increase of 2.0°C is already 11% 
of the world’s GDP, not to mention the 
other dramatic changes expected, such as 
increasing extreme weather conditions, loss 
of agricultural land, etc.2 However, there is still 
time to take action, and we must take it jointly 
and immediately.

One of the crucial steps needed is to change 
the way we organize our supply chains 
and logistics. We must avoid unnecessary 
transport and empty trips, and optimize the 
use of existing capacity, as well as make use 
of the most sustainable transport solutions 
available. Transparency on the sources of 
emissions in our transport system is vital to 
achieving this outcome.

To enable this transparency, the Global 
Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) has 
developed the GLEC Framework, which 
provides guidance on the calculation and 
reporting of freight transport systems, 
chains and operations. This framework, first 
published in 2016, brings together in one 
place concepts and learning from the world’s 
leading approaches for calculating greenhouse 
gas emissions arising from freight transport.

In response to industry requests, work on 
an ISO standard using the GLEC Framework 
as a basis began in 2019, with the objective 
of providing an internationally accepted and 
established format for the calculation and 
reporting of transport related GHG emissions. 

Over three years, experts from all over the 
world collaborated on the development of ISO 
14083, which was published in 2023 under the 
title of:

Greenhouse gases — Quantification and 
reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
arising from transport chain operations.

Following its publication, we have integrated 
the provisions of ISO 14083:2023 back into 
the GLEC Framework. The outcome, GLEC 
Framework v3, is now in front of you. From 
the GLEC Framework v1 & v2 to the GLEC 
Framework v3 – this document brings together 
the accessibility of the GLEC Framework and 
the requirements of ISO 14083 (see Figure 1 
on next page).

The GLEC Framework v3 guides and supports 
companies in implementing transparency 
on the efficiency of their supply chains and 
logistics. It offers an easy-to-use approach 
to an ISO 14083-compliant calculation of 
GHG emissions from transport, covering the 
transport itself as well as logistics hubs and 
the emissions from the energy supply to 
them both. Throughout the GLEC Framework 
you will find the relevant references to ISO 
14083. Third party assurance of emission 
reports is crucial for building trust and 
credibility, while also highlighting the efficiency 
and sustainability effort of companies that 
engage in transport improvements. Using 
the GLEC Framework will ensure your GHG 
Emissions Report is ready to be verified by 
an assurance provider.

Introduction
Global Logistics 
Emissions Council

Many companies have made huge efforts in 
recent years to reduce their carbon footprint 
and improve the efficiency and sustainability 
of their transport chains. Their efforts are 
most valuable and important, and the GLEC 
industry partners have incorporated their 
insights into the GLEC Framework v3. We 
thank all those who have contributed their 
expertise and experience. You have made this 
journey possible.

For those of you who have used the GLEC 
Framework before, you will find a separate 
chapter on the key changes implemented in 
the GLEC Framework v3 compared to the - 
GLEC Framework v2. For everyone else, 
we hope that this document opens the door 
to the next chapter for your company, 
enabling you to improve your efficiency 
and supporting you in your contribution to 
reaching climate targets.

For a further acceleration of changes, it is 
now important that all companies analyze the 
efficiency of their transport and logistics and 
take any possible and necessary steps to 
optimize their transport system’s efficiency. 
In particular, multinationals hold the key to 
reaching climate targets, especially those with 
global brands and supply chains. As buyers 
or suppliers of freight services, they have 
the power to change the way we organize 
logistics and supply chains. They can act as 
leaders through reporting carbon emissions, 
setting climate targets, and collaborating with 
partners to achieve them.

If you have any questions or suggestions, 
please let us know. And if you are looking for a 
platform to exchange experiences in emission 
accounting, reporting and reduction, come 
and join Smart Freight Centre’s (SFC’s) GLEC 
program. We can only reach the necessary 
low emission freight transport system in 
cooperation with your active participation.

Introduction to 
Logistics Emission 
Accounting
Freight Transport’s 
Climate Impact

Transport demand is expected to double by 2050, driven largely 
by Asia, Africa and Latin America. Even in its most optimistic 
scenario, the International Transport Forum expects a doubling 
of transport demand to over 270,000 billion tkm for all transport 
modes combined by 2050. In its highest scenario, levels of 
almost 350,000 billion tkm are expected.3

Without intervention, freight transport emissions will more 
than double by 2050.

Logistics’ 
climate impact 
is large 
and growing

It doesn’t 
have to be 
that way

The logistics sector plays a vital role in the 
supply chains which lie at the heart of the 
global economy. The maritime and rail sectors 
are critical enablers of the flow of energy 
resources such as oil and natural gas, as 
well as commodities such as steel, fertilizers 
and containerized consumer goods. The 
aviation sector plays an important role in 
moving time-sensitive products and high-
value consumer goods. At the base, there is 
road transport – the most ubiquitous form of 
freight transportation to points of consumption 
around the world. All these modes are linked 
by various types of transport hub where goods 
are stored, repacked and distributed.

The climate impact of logistics and the transport 
sector accounts for around 60% of global oil 
demand. The reduction in transport activity during 
the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a massive 
temporary reduction of GHG emissions as road 
transport and aviation transport demand were 
drastically reduced. The International Energy 
Agency estimates that the reduced road transport 
demand can be linked to a reduction of 50% 
in global oil demand and the reduced aviation 
transport to a reduction of 36% during the 
pandemic. At the same time, the demand for low-
carbon technologies, including solar photovoltaic 
(PV) and wind energy, increased to unprecedented 
levels, raising their share in the global energy mix 
to over 20%.4 In fact until 2021, transport related 
oil demand levels were below pre-pandemic 
levels, resulting in a reduced annual emission of 
600 Mt CO2 emissions compared to 2019 levels. 
The trend of growth in transport demand, with 
the related GHG emissions has returned since 
then and is continuing5. Further action is therefore 
needed to reach climate targets.6

Growth in the logistics sector does not 
necessarily have to mean growth in 
emissions. Indeed, to meet global climate 
goals – limiting global temperature 
increase to 1.5°C from pre-industrial levels 
– governments, the logistics sector and 
its many customers will need to make a 
concerted effort to decarbonize freight 
transportation. 

More efficient operational practices like 
load consolidation, modal switch, and 
energy-efficient driving have the potential 
to decrease emissions without the need for 
capital investments. Zero and low-emission 
freight technologies are also increasingly 
available and have strong potential for 
reducing carbon emissions, most notably 
the adoption of renewable energy for 
transportation and logistics sites. Ambitious 
decarbonization policies can enhance 
industry actions and drive further reductions. 
Committing to tracking and reporting our 
carbon emissions is essential to determine 
whether we are on track to achieve our goal.

Introduction
Global Logistics 
Emissions Council

Why companies 
use the GLEC 
Framework

GHG emissions have become the default metric for 
communicating climate sustainability between buyers, 
suppliers, investors, customers and governments and beyond. 
Tracking GHG emissions over time allows companies to use 
both total emissions and emission intensity as key performance 
indicators (KPIs) in operational and supply chain planning and 
target-setting.

Despite this, carbon accounting for logistics is still a relatively 
new practice. The complexity of the sector requires a simple 
and practical approach that companies of all sizes and 
institutional capacities can apply – the GLEC Framework 
offers such an approach.

Here are some ways the GLEC Framework 
streamlines GHG emission accounting across 
supply chains and geographies:

The Framework works with Industry 
Standards
The GLEC Framework aligns with ISO 14083 
and is recognized by the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. It is the recommended method for 
reporting logistics emissions to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) and for setting 
targets in line with the Science-Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi).

The Framework works for all transport 
stakeholders
Covering the entire transport chain, the 
Framework works for carriers, logistics service 
providers (LSPs) and shippers as well as 
other end-users of emissions information, 
such as governments, investors and green 
freight programs. It works for companies 
just beginning to account for their transport 
emissions through to those that have full 
visibility of emissions in their operations and 
supply chain – and provides an accessible 
and realistic pathway for the former to 
progress and achieve the latter. With its global 
applicability, it can also provide guidance to 
policymakers who are looking to implement 
carbon accounting regulations for transport.

The Framework works for decision-making
GHG accounting can be used in investment, 
procurement and sales strategies to assess the 
impact of different scenarios, predict the carbon 
return on investment and track progress toward 
climate goals following implementation. This 
leads to improved efficiency and bottom-line 
financial savings, alongside reduced climate and 
health impacts.

The Framework works with green 
freight programs
Green freight programs play a critical role in 
connecting shippers and carriers around the 
globe. Accounting and reporting freight activity 
are part of the broader process of supply chain 
efficiency and sustainability efforts that green 
freight programs help to support.

The GLEC’s partnerships with global green 
freight programs, such as the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 
SmartWay, Clean Cargo, Lean & Green, Clean 
Air Transport, Sea Cargo Charter, Smart Freight 
Alliance China and Programa de Logística Verde, 
are essential for streamlining carbon accounting 
and emission reduction on a global scale.

How to use the 
GLEC Framework

The GLEC Framework offers clear guidance while leaving 
enough space for adaptability to the specific needs of your 
situation. It provides information on the requirements toward 
the definition of boundaries and data sourcing throughout the 
entire transport chain, from sender to receiver. Different levels 
of granularity in the detailing of transport chain analysis can 
be realized with it. It also maps out reporting requirements 
from the basic “must-have” to very advanced levels of detailed 
information to ensure that you can gain the best insights 
possible into the improvement potential within your transport 
and logistics services. 

The GLEC Framework introduces the 
concept of operation categories, transport 
operation categories (TOC) and hub 
operation categories (HOC). These are 
groups of operations that share similar 
characteristics. Such an identification of 
TOCs and HOCs provides a tool to structure 
your transport services – those provided 
and used – and to identify relevant emission 
intensities, according to the specific situation 
of your organization. (More details are to 
be found in Section 1 chapter 2 Calculation 
Steps: Establishing of the relevant TOC or 

HOC). The Framework in the presented form 
focuses on the most common situations to 
keep it easy to use. To make the application 
even more accessible, example cases and 
company-specific use cases are to be found 
in Module 4. Therefore, you can use the 
document to familiarize yourself with GHG 
emission accounting and reporting. At the same 
time, advanced users of emission accounting 
tools will find all necessary information on the 
concept and requirements of ISO 14083. For 
ease of orientation, the end of each paragraph 
references the related ISO chapters. 

Scope 3 includes indirect emissions from the 
reporting company’s supply chain, such as 
transportation emissions and product use. The 
GLEC Framework v3, in line with ISO 14083, 
divides the overall GHG emissions into emissions 
related to the energy use for the operation of 
transport or hub activities and the emissions 
related to the provision of this energy. Whereas 
the emissions of the transport operations – hub 
and transport activity – constiute the tank-to-
wheel (TTW) (also referred to as “tank-to-wake” 
where appropriate) emissions, the energy 
provision emissions for energy used for transport 
activity or hub operations make up the well-to-
tank (WTT) emissions. With the v3.1 update, 
minor changes have been implemented, primarily 
data sources used in Module 3. A detailed 
overview of the tracked version can be found in 
the Glossary on page 171.

Changes 
introduced in 
Framework v3 in 
comparison to v2

The GLEC Framework v3 has the transport 
chain and its transport chain elements (TCEs) 
as its starting point, just like its predecessor. 
However, the perspective of analysis and 
reporting have evolved slightly. 

The GLEC Framework v2 classified logistics 
emissions into three scopes, following the 
principles of accounting put forward by the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1 includes 
direct emissions from assets owned or controlled 
by the reporting company, Scope 2 includes 
indirect emissions from the production and 
distribution of electricity, heat and steam 
purchased by the reporting company and

Introduction
Global Logistics 
Emissions Council

So, where does this leave Scope 1, Scope 2 
and Scope 3 emissions. See also Figure 5: 
Scopes of accounting.

The ownership of the vehicle or equipment 
carrying out the transport or hub operation is 
not decisive for the calculation of emissions. 
It is the position of the reporting organization 
within the value chain that determines which 
scope category the emissions fall into. The link 
between transport operation providers and 
users is provided via reporting between supply 
chain partners. Traditional Scope 3 users of 
transport services will need to be provided 
with information on the activity carried out and 
the related emission intensities, or with the 
readily calculated emissions of their transport 
chains from Scope 1 and Scope 2 providers of 
transport services. (For further details, see also 
Section 2 Chapter 1 Reporting Emissions).

The concept of TOC and HOC has been 
updated and given additional prominence. 
Previously referred to as Transport Service 
Categories (TSCs), TOCs and HOCs serve two 
major purposes: providing the boundary for 
the calculation of emission intensity values, 
and the allocation of emission intensity values 
for specific TCEs. These TOCs and HOCs 

are clusters of transport or hub activities of 
similar character and emission intensity. There 
are guidelines for the clustering of transport 
or hub services into categories, which can 
be found in Section 1 Chapter 4, Information 
and Requirements for the Individual Transport 
Modes. Each organization providing transport 
services must build the TOC and HOC clusters 
in line with its specific situation, ideally 
aligned with the information needs of its key 
customers. (For more information on TOCs and 
HOCs, see Chapter 3 Steps for establishing the 
emission intensity factors of a TOC or a HOC).

Further changes are the inclusion of:
• additional modes of transport  
  (pipelines and cable cars)
• processes of hub equipment energy provision
• construction and dismantling of energy 
   infrastructure (to be embedded within  
  emission factors)
• start-up and idling of vehicles, pipelines,  
  transshipment and (de)boarding equipment
• cleaning/flushing operations for pipelines
• combustion and/or leakage of energy carriers  
  at vehicle or hub equipment level
• leakage of refrigerants used by vehicles  
  and hubs
• amendments to reporting requirements

Figure 5

Scopes of 
accounting

The GHG protocol classifies emissions into three categories, 
Scope 1, 2 and 3. ISO 14083 avoids this distinction, as these 
scope differentiations are considered commercially driven 
distinctions. Instead, ISO 14083 distinguishes between direct 
and indirect emissions.

Scope 1

Scope 2

Scope 3

Direct emissions
Direct emissions from assets 
that are owned or controlled by 
the reporting company 

Electricity emissions
Indirect emissions from electrictiy 
heat, and steam purchased by 
the reporting company

Indirect emissions
Indirect emissions from assets 
that are not owned or controlled 
by the reporting company.

Scope 1 emissions include the 
direct emissions from assets that 
are owned or controlled by the 
reporting company. This includes 
the combustion of solid or liquid 
fuels purchased to produce 
energy, heat or steam for use in 
stationary or mobile equipment 
(e.g. vehicles, vessels, aircraft, 
locomotives, generators) and/
or buildings associated with 
logistics sites (e.g. warehouses).

Scope 2 emissions are indirect 
emissions from the production and 
distribution of electricity, heat and 
steam purchased by the reporting 
company for use in its own 
logistics sites, electric vehicles 
or other owned asset requiring 
electricity.

Scope 3 emissions include the 
indirect emissions from assets 
that are not owned or controlled 
by the reporting company. This 
includes the transportation 
emissions required to move goods 
from suppliers to the reporting 
company and from the reporting 
company to the end customer; 
when these operations are not 
carried out by the reporting 
company. Scope 3 also covers 
the production and distribution of 
fuels burned in Scope 1, transport 
emissions embedded within 
purchased goods and services, 
product use and end-of-life.

How the Framework 
is organized

This document is divided into three primary 
sections. Section 1 covers the calculations 
themselves. It is divided into Chapter 1, which 
provides an overview of the foundations and 
principles of the GLEC Framework; Chapter 
2, which guides you through the steps in 
emissions accounting and Chapter 3, which 
explains how the emission intensity factors for 
TOCs and HOCs are established. Chapter 4 
then provides additional information specific to 
each transportation mode and logistics hubs. 

In Section 2, information on how to report and 
use calculation results is detailed. Chapter 1 
of Section 2 provides information on reporting 
and disclosure, and Chapter 2 of Section 2 
discusses ways in which carbon emissions can 
be used in decision-making and target-setting.

Chapter 3 gives an overview on the next 
developments targeted for further advancing 
freight transport emission calculation and 
reporting.

These first two sections are followed 
by Section 3, which holds all additional 
information for the data sourcing and 
calculation of GHG emissions, including 
real-life examples. Section 3 is divided into 
modules, with Module 1 listing Fuel Emission 
Factors, Module 2 Default Energy Efficiency 
and CO2e Intensity Factors, Module 3 
Refrigerant Emission Factors and Module 4 
the Calculation Examples.

Information on references can be found at 
the end of each section. In Section 4 you 
find Module 5, the guidance on “Calculating 
GHG transport and logistics emissions for 
the European Chemical Industry”, as well as 
further information on units and conversion 
factors, a glossary and an overview on 
abbreviations used.

In practice, we know logistics accounting isn’t always a linear process. You 
may find yourself going back and forth between sections to learn more about a 
certain mode, check the glossary or find data collection guidance. As new data 
becomes available, you may return to the Framework to refine calculations. 

In any case, we hope the information you are looking for is here and, if not, we 
encourage you to get in touch and ask questions at www.smartfreightcentre.org

Framework

1

An organization’s emission footprint from its 
freight transport and hub operations is the 
sum of emissions of all transport chains, 
taking into consideration emissions from the 
organization’s own operations, purchased 
energy and subcontracted operations (Scope 
1, 2 and 3) as well as emissions across the 
full fuel/energy life cycle. This applies to 
organizations that are transport providers 
as well as to their customers. The GLEC 
Framework v3 covers all of these.

1. Coverage of all operations 
in the transport chain

The GLEC Framework aims to cover all 
freight transport and hub operations along 
the transport chain. It covers transport 
operations from national to international 
levels, anywhere in the world. Transshipment 
points along a journey, such as ports or 
warehouses where goods are transferred, 
stored or repackaged are also included. They 
are classed together as hubs. Furthermore, 
in line with the scope of ISO 14083, freight 
transport using pipelines and cable cars is 
added to this new GLEC Framework.

Calculating emissions of transport 
chains based on TCEs’ emissions

The starting point for the calculation of GHG 
emissions from transport operations is the 
identification of “transport chains.” A transport 
chain always begins at the point where an item 
of freight is leaving a consignor, i.e. the point 
of departure of a shipment, which is often 
the sender or shipper. It ends when the item 
reaches its consignee, i.e. usually the receiver 
of the shipment, also defined as the point 
where the first non-transport related operation 
is carried out on the freight. Both consignor 
and consignee, can also be e.g. wholesalers, 
retailers or intermediaries.

The GLEC Framework, in line with ISO 14083, 
calculates emissions per transport chain. To 
ensure the consideration of empty operations 
and the accounting of the related emissions, 
the use of vehicles in transport chains is based 
on a round trip approach, both for calculation 
of emission intensities and for the allocation of 

emissions to consignments in shared transport. 
Therefore, the necessary return of a vehicle is 
included, even though freight is usually moved 
from consignor to consignee in one direction 
only. This ensures that all emissions related to 
a transport operation are included.

Once a transport chain is identified, it is 
subdivided intoTCEs. A TCE is defined by 
freight being carried by a single vehicle or 
transiting through a single hub. So, each 
change of vehicle or hub requires the 
identification of a separate TCE and therefore a 
separate calculation of its GHG emissions.

The GHG emissions calculated for each TCE 
are added to calculate the emissions of the 
entire transport chain (see Figure 3). Finally, the 
emissions from all transport chains within an 
organization’s logistics supply chain are added 
to give the organization’s total freight and 
logistics emissions.

Calculating emission for three 
scopes of an organization

The GHG Protocol also has as a key objective 
the consideration of all emissions from one 
organization, direct as well as indirect (see 
also Introduction to Logistics Emission 
Accounting, Info box Scopes of Accounting). 
For this purpose, it distinguishes between the 
organization’s directly owned emissions (Scope 
1), indirectly owned emissions (Scope 2), and 
indirect, not-owned emissions (Scope 3). 

Emissions of an organization, e.g. an LSP 
or shipper, are calculated by adding up 
all emissions from transport chains that 
are used by the organization as well as 
its subcontractors. What is considered as 
Scope 1 or 3 depends on the organization’s 
perspective. For a carrier or hauler, transport-
related emissions are considered Scope 1, but 
for their customer (and LSP or shipper) these 
emissions are included in Scope 3.

in particular 3.1.25 Transport Chain (TC), and 3.1.26

2. Inclusion of all IPCC 
greenhouse gases and 
climate pollutants

We are continuously learning about the 
relevance of new gases on the climate. The 
list of GHGs is therefore regularly updated. 
The GLEC Framework v3 is fully aligned 
with the current list of GHGs included in ISO 
14083, the GHG protocol, the SBTi and the 
United Nations IPCC.8 These GHG emissions 
are quantified in CO2 equivalents (CO2e). 
The reason for this is that carbon dioxide 
comprises the majority of GHG emissions for 
logistics operations and is thus the standard 
reference by which emissions are quantified. 
CO2e is the common unit used to represent 
the global warming impact of the various 
GHGs according to their Global Warming 
Potential (GWP). Therefore, CO2e is used as 
such throughout the GLEC Framework in line 
with ISO 14083.

GHGs included in ISO 14083 and the GLEC 
Framework v3 are: 
• CO2 Carbon Dioxide
• CH4 Methane
• CFCs Chlorofluorocarbons
• HFCs Hydrofluorocarbons
• NF3 Nitrogen trifluoride
• N2O Nitrous oxide
• PFCs Perfluorocarbon
• SF6 Sulphur hexafluoride
• SO2F2 Sulfuryl fluoride

Black carbon

Black carbon is the term used for particulate 
matter emitted from partial combustion of 
complex hydrocarbon fuels. As such, it is 
prevalent in freight transport which often 
relies on such fuels. It is a short-lived climate 
pollutant with potent global warming potential 
and a negative effect on human health. 
The GLEC Framework provides a separate 
approach to calculate emissions from black 
carbon in “The Black Carbon Methodology for 
the Logistics Sector.” This approach for the 
calculation of black carbon was developed 
by the Smart Freight Centre, the UN Climate 
and Clean Air Coalition, the International 
Council on Clean Transportation and the US 
Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay 
team as an optional element to the GLEC 
Framework v2 and is also included as an 
optional (“informative”) Annex to ISO 14083.9 

The Black Carbon Methodology provides a 
way to calculate emissions from black carbon 
following the same principles as the GLEC 
Framework.

3. Coverage of emissions 
from all forms of fuel and 
energy sources

The GLEC Framework accounts for all relevant 
logistics emissions from transport operations, 
as well as the emissions resulting from the 
energy or fuel provision related to these 
operations. It includes the energy consumption 
of all transport operation related processes, 
regardless of whether this energy consumption 
is caused by combustion, by fuel leakage or 
by refrigerant leakage. For hub operational 
processes, all handling, on-site transportation 
and transshipment as well as (dis)embarking 
equipment and facilities, including heating and 
temperature control are considered. Covered 
by the GLEC Framework v3 are therefore:

• processes of vehicle operations;
• processes of hub equipment operation 
   (including operations of forklifts, pallet  
  trucks, etc.);
• processes of vehicle energy provision;
• processes of hub equipment energy  
  provision;*
• any loaded and empty trips made by  
  vehicles, including diversionary and/or 
  out-of-route distance;
• construction and dismantling of energy  
  infrastructure;* 
• start-up and idling of vehicles, pipelines,  
  transshipment and (de)boarding equipment;*
• cleaning/flushing operations for pipelines;*
• combustion and/or leakage of energy carriers  
  at vehicle or hub equipment level;*

• leakage of refrigerants used by vehicles 
  and hubs;*
* = new additions since GLEC Framework v2 

As the GLEC Framework v3 includes all 
modes of transport, as well as any hubs 
which are part of the transport chain, energy 
consumptions of contractors and any form of 
subcontractors, as well as their combustion 
and leakages, are included, independent of 
who is carrying out these operations.

Ensuring energy provision 
emission inclusion

To ensure the best emission calculation result 
for the available energy consumption data, 
the best accessible or recommended (e.g. 
nationally prescribed) GHG emission factors 
are to be used. This ensures the inclusion 
of GHG emissions resulting from upstream 
processes and those of the energy carriers. 
The following activities are to be included for 
the respective energy-carrier:

• For solid, liquid and gaseous energy 
  carriers: the production and dismantling 
  of the infrastructure of the energy source; 
  extraction or cultivation of primary  
  energy; chemical processing; transport and  
  distribution (including pipeline) of energy at all  
  steps of the production of the energy carrier.
• For electricity: extraction, processing and 
  transport of primary energy; power 
  generation; power generation infrastructure,  
  e.g. solar panel or wind turbine manufacture;  
  and grid losses associated with transmission  
  and distribution of electricity. 

Should the recommended or best available 
GHG emission factors not include 
the production and dismantling of the 
infrastructure of the energy source, it is 
important to note this in the emission 
reporting. Omission of any processes from 

the calculation of emissions is not permitted. 
Where any omissions are made despite 
this general rule, these must be stated and 
justified in the report (see Section 2 Chapter 1 
Reporting Emissions).

Figure 5 
Calculating 
WTW emissions 
of a transport 
chain

WTT emissions within the GLEC 
Framework v3 and ISO 14083 are 
referred to as energy provision 
emissions. WTT refers to a “method 
used to calculate the energy 
consumed and GHG emitted from the 
moment of production of a transport 
fuel (petrol, diesel, electricity, natural 
gas) to the moment of fuel supply (at 
the recharging or refueling station.)”9

TTW emissions, also referred to 
as “tank-to-wake” emissions, are 
referred to as transport operations 
activity emissions within the GLEC 
Framework v3 and include also hub 
operation activity emissions. TTW 

refers to a method used to calculate 
the energy consumed and GHG 
emitted from the point of transmission 
of transport fuel to the vehicle (at the 
recharging or refueling station) to the 
moment of its discharge (consumption 
of the fuel or electricity, while on the 
move.)“9

WTW or “well-to-wake” emissions are 
the sum of WTT and TTW emissions. 
Together they comprise the total 
emissions of a TCE. The GLEC 
Framework v3, like the ISO 14083, is 
based on the WTW concept, i.e. the 
inclusion of the total emissions of a 
transport chain and its elements.

Calculating emissions across 
the fuel/energy life cycle

ISO 14083 and the GLEC Framework v3 
require that calculating emissions of a 
transport chain covers the full fuel/energy 
life cycle. This includes both emissions from 
energy and fuel consumption TTW as well 
as their provision WTT, which combined are  
WTW emissions (see Figure 10 Calculating 
WTW emissions of a transport chain). 
Consequently, an organization that is using the 
GLEC Framework v3 needs to include WTW 
emissions from fuel/energy used in emission 
calculation for all transport chains so that 
both emissions from transport operations 
and related energy provision are taken into 
consideration. 

Special considerations for 
alternative energy sources

To cover the entire emissions of a transport or 
hub operation activity, energy provision (WTT) 
emissions need to be included. For alternative 
energy sources this can be challenging. 
It is particularly relevant where GHGs are 
emitted in the WTT phase (e.g. from hydrogen 
and electricity) or where CO2 emitted in 
combustion is considered to be balanced by 
carbon sequestration of CO2 in the feedstock 
production phase (biofuels.)

For this reason, as biofuels and renewable 
energy sources gain a larger market share, 
ISO 14083 gives guidelines for the inclusion 
of energy provision emissions.

Biofuel
Because biofuel production methods vary 
more widely than conventional fuels due to 
different feedstock and associated processes, 
there is no single standard recognized 
emission intensity value for the energy 
provision (WTT). Biofuel providers will be able 
to provide this value directly; other sources 
may be life cycle databases, government 
agencies and green freight programs. Annex 
J of ISO 14083 sets out the elements to be 
considered in the calculation of the upstream 
processes and emission relevant activities.

Biofuel in Conventional Fuels
Conventional fuels often include a small 
percentage of biofuel; this can be reflected 
within the GLEC Framework emission 
calculations with relatively low uncertainty.

Electricity
When calculating the emissions from 
electricity consumption, the source of 
energy used to create the electricity has to 
be considered. Therefore, specific emission 
factors are used to convert electricity use to 
CO2e, based on the source(s) of energy used 
to generate the electricity used. Emission 
factors are expressed as mass of CO2e 
released per kilowatt hours (kWh).

The electrification of transport systems with 
renewable energy sources is seen as a key 
strategy for a successful and meaningful 
decarbonization of the transport sector. To 
track emissions from electrified operations, 
companies must gather electricity emission 
factors for countries or regions.

Growing investment in renewable energy 
technologies means that electricity emission 
factors in some countries are changing rapidly. 
Therefore, organizations’ databases should be 
updated regularly.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) 
compiles and publishes annually updated lists 
of national electricity emission factors, and we 
recommend companies use this as a source 
of information. The factors are available for 
purchase from the IEA website.

IEA electricity emissions factors include data 
for the following items: 
• gCO2/kWh produced during electricity  
  generation
• gCO2e/kWh contribution from CH4 produced 
  during electricity generation
• gCO2e/kWh contribution from N2O 
  produced during electricity generation
• Correction for transmission and distribution 
  losses induced emissions (gCO2/kWh)
• Correction for trade induced emissions 
   (gCO2/kWh)

Chapter 1
Foundations 
of the GLEC 
Framework

To ensure a full WTW approach, all these 
elements must be included in the national 
electricity emission values. (ISO 14083 Annex 
J.3 gives detailed guidance on the application 
of electricity emission factors, especially on 
location-based vs. market-based factors.)

accepted value for hydrogen fuel cell WTT 
emissions. Please refer to the producer for

4. Alignment with key 
international standards 
and base methodologies

At the core of the GLEC Framework is 
the alignment of global efforts in carbon 
accounting for logistics operations. It builds 
on international standards and harmonizes 
practices and guidelines for green freight 
programs developed by industry, experts, 
practitioners and governments around the 
world. This improves compatibility and 
comparability of results, while streamlining 
data collection and reporting efforts.

The following table gives an overview 
of the key international standards and 
methodologies with which the GLEC 
Framework v3 is aligned (Table 1).

Exclusions from the 
GLEC Framework

Not included in the calculation of GHG 
emissions are:
• the production and supply processes  
  of refrigerants;
• waste produced;
• processes at the administrative (overhead)  
  level of the organizations involved in the
  transport services;
• processes for the construction of vehicles
  and transport or transshipment devices 
  (e.g. embedded GHG emissions associated  
  with vehicle production);

An organization’s freight and logistics emissions are the sum of 
emissions from transport chains, which in turn consists of multiple 
TCEs. The GLEC Framework v3 takes a bottom-up approach and 
starts with TCEs. This chapter explains the calculation steps for 
emissions for each TCE. 

The calculation of GHG Emissions is carried out in three steps:
1. Calculate the transport activity of the TCE.
2. Identify the applicable emission intensity of this TCE by 
establishing the relevant TOC or HOC applicable.
3. Calculate the TCE’s emissions by multiplying the transport 
activity with the emission intensity value.

Calculation of the activity 
of the TCE

Calculation of transport activities

Transport activity of a TCE is expressed 
in tonne-kilometers (tonne-km or tkm). 
Therefore, to calculate the transport activity 
of a TCE, you need to establish the freight 
mass that is transported as well as the 
distance. Freight mass is quantified in metric 
tons (1 metric ton = 1000 kg) or in kg. If other 
units of weight are used, these must be 
clearly stated and communicated, including 
in the reporting. In some cases, different 
approaches can be necessary:
• If the weight of the transported freight  
  is known in Twenty-foot Equivalent Units 
  (TEUs) only and not in kg or metric tons, 
  an average weight of 10 tonnes per TEU  
  can be assumed. If the containers are 
  light, then 6 tonnes can be used as  
  approximation, and if they are heavy, an 
  average weight of 14.5 tonnes can  
  be assumed.
• For special transports, e.g. parcel and post  
  operations or other containerized special  
  freight, different weight units can be 
  applied. Such different approaches will  
  need to be clearly documented. (See ISO    
  14083 chapter 5.4.2 for details.) 

The distance of transport activities is 
quantified in km and stretches from 

consignor to consignee. The use of different 
units for distance is also possible here if 
these are clearly stated and communicated, 
including in the reporting. The transport 
activity distance is either the shortest feasible 
distance (SFD), or the Great Circle Distance 
(GCD) (see text box on distances).

The resulting value is expressed in tonne-
kilometers. One tonne-kilometer represents 
one tonne of cargo moving for one kilometer. 
The tonne-kilometer provides a useful and 
consistent “common denominator” to express 
efficiency for freight transportation just as 
distance does in a simple fuel efficiency metric 
such as a “miles per gallon” or “liters per 
100km” figure.

Capturing shipment mass and distance in 
an accurate and consistent manner can 
be surprisingly difficult to achieve, largely 
because it is a concept that is not yet 
widespread at the organization level. Shippers 
may not be able to acquire this information 
from their carriers, and carriers may struggle 
to correlate their transport activity with 
actual energy consumption. The following 
paragraphs give guidance on how to establish 
the shipment weight and transport distance.

Mass weight can be consistently applied 
across the supply chain, as this approach is 
in line with the key approaches for transport 
operation emission calculation. Volume, 
density and other metrics may be used by 
companies for analysis and, in some cases, 
reporting, but mass should be communicated 
alongside these metrics to ensure consistency 
along the multimodal supply chain.

must not include additional packaging or

Transport Management System (TMS), etc.

Capturing transport distance data

While it may seem simple to establish the 
distance of transport operations, especially 
considering developments in GPS and 
telematics systems, quantifying distance 
consistently and accurately is part of what 
makes logistics emissions accounting a 
complicated endeavor. 

Many shipments are moved via multiple 
transport legs and modes, and some are 
handled by multiple carriers. Sometimes there 
are intermediate stopovers in locations that 
reflect a carrier’s transport network rather than 
the most direct route; sometimes routes are 
modified due to weather, tides, construction or 
traffic conditions, information that may or may 
not be known to other parties.

This is further complicated by goods traveling 
on shared transport assets, where shipments 
are consolidated to increase vehicle loading 
and hence efficiency but may lead to longer 
distances being traveled than would be the 
most direct route for an individual shipment.

The GLEC Framework is based on the concept 
of transport chains and TCEs (see also Section 
1 Chapter 1 The Transport Chain). The distance 
of a transport chain is measured from the 
point where the shipper hands goods over 
to the carrier, so when leaving the consignor, 
and ends with the hand-over of the shipment 
to another carrier or the consignee. The 
distance of a transport TCE is defined by 

freight being carried by a single vehicle (hub 
TCEs are associated with zero distance), with 
each change of vehicle or hub requiring the 
identification and calculation of a separate TCE. 
Distance information must be collected for 
each TCE, either through direct measurement 
or estimation. Three common approaches to 
establishing distance are used within the GLEC 
Framework: SFD, GCD and actual 
distance corrected by a Distance Adjustment 
Factor (DAF). 

Guidance for distance calculation for each 
mode is provided in the mode specifications in 
Section 1 Chapter 4.

Once mass and distance are established per 
TCE, the transport activity can be calculated, 
preferably in in tonne-kilometers. This is done 
by multiplying the mass of a consignment, 
quantified in tonnes, by the transport activity 
distance of this specific consignment, 
measured in kilometers. The resulting tonne-
kilometer brings together weight and distance 
as the metric for freight transport activity. It is 
important to calculate the transport activity 
per shipment of each TCE separately. In line 
with ISO 14083 a shipment is defined as an 
“identifiable collection of one or more freight 
items (available to be) transported together from 
the original shipper to the ultimate consignee.”9 
For establishing the tonne-kilometer for 
an entire TCE, the tonne-kilometer of each 
shipment is then added in a next step.

Distances

SFD
SFD represents the shortest practical route 
between two places taking into account 
the real operating conditions, such as 
the physical restrictions of a vehicle (e.g. 
weight and height), road type, topography 
and congestion and is typically found 
using route planning software. For most 
situations, it is the recommended approach. 
(It is important to keep in mind that SFD 
does not reflect the shortest distance if 
you are willing to risk shortcuts that might 
be unsuitable for your vehicle type or 
congestion typical of a city center.)

GCD 
Also known as direct distance or “as the 
crow flies,” GCD is an approach to distance 
measurement that is currently focused on 
air transport. It is the shortest distance 
between two points by crow-line, including 
the curving of the earth. While this is a 
compelling option for harmonizing distance 
measurement across multimodal supply 
chains, it is currently not widely known or 
accepted outside of the aviation industry.

Actual distance corrected by a DAF
Where neither SFD nor GCD are available, 
the actual distance in combination with a 
DAF can be used. Based on odometer 
readings or knowledge of the actual route, 
the true actual distance is generally only 
known by the carrier. In most cases, a shipper 
or LSP does not have access to the actual 
distances traveled by its subcontracted 
carriers. The application of the DAF enables 
compatibility between different elements of 
the GHG emission calculations – specifically 
if an emission intensity is calculated based on 
actual distance, whilst the end user only has 
access to transport activity based on 
the SFD.

particular 3.1.27 Transport distance and 3.3.4 Distance 
adjustment factor

22

Calculation of hub operation activities

Hub operation activity is quantified based on 
the tonnes throughput of shipments leaving 
the center, i.e. outbound freight. 

Inclusion of packaging 
into the freight’s weight

It is important, that you always include the 
mass of the packaging provided by the 
consignor when establishing the weight of 
the freight. 

Instead, the weight of packaging necessary 
for transport or hub operations, such as the 
mass of pallets or of containers, are not to 
be included. Be aware though, that, when 
empty containers are transported, they are 
considered as the freight. In these cases, the 
empty container’s weight equals the mass of 
the transported and handled freight.

Identification of the applicable 
emission intensity for the TCE

In order to identify the emission intensity 
applicable for a specific TCE, it must be 
established to which TOC or HOC this TCE 
can be linked. A TOC is a group of transport 
operations that share similar characteristics 
and a HOC is a group of hub operations that 
share similar characteristics, in a defined 
period, which is typically one calendar year 
unless specified otherwise and explained in 
the related reporting. 

These shared characteristics can be based on 
various criteria, such as the mode of transport, 

journey type, type of cargo being transported, 
temperature-controlled transport, specific 
trade lanes, the nature of freight carried, or the 
nature of the contractual agreement. (Further 
suggestions for the characteristics which can 
be used to establish TOCs can be found in the 
transport mode specific chapters of Section 
1 Chapter 4). Transport is rarely carried out in 
isolation for each piece of freight or shipment. 
Instead, it is usually bundled to optimize space 
and time. The identification of TOCs and 
HOCs also contributes to avoiding the need 
for calculating emission intensity for each and 
every individual transport. 

Both TOCs and HOCs, can have different 
levels of granularity, depending on the analysis 
needed and the data available (see also Info 
box Granularity of TOCs and HOCs). ISO 
14083 suggests as examples (see also Info box 
Recommendations Regarding Granularity of 
TOCs and HOCs):
• TOC of a single vehicle on a single journey
• TOC of a single vehicle in multiple schedules
• TOC of a specific vehicle type in a single  
  journey
• TOC of a specific vehicle type in multiple  
  schedules
• TOC of a specified group of vehicles in a  
  single schedule
• TOC of a specified group of vehicles in  
  multiple schedules
• Hubs or terminals with transshipment and/or  
  warehousing as relevant services, etc.

Based on this emission intensity value of the 
relevant TOC or HOC, the emissions of an 
individual transport chain element can then 
be calculated.

These TOC or HOC specific emission 
intensities can either be calculated using 
primary data or they can be modeled, or 
default values can be applied, depending on 
which data is available (see Info box Data 
Categories). It is important to remember that 
only good quality primary and modeled data 
are representative of actual conditions of the 

analyzed transport operations and transport 
chains. Default factors are just best-case 
approximations to the actual situation. Using 
default factors limits the ability to use carbon 
emissions as a KPI to evaluate carriers, routes 
and other operational differences.

Recommendations 
regarding the 
granularity of 
TOCs and HOCs

Align TOC and HOC definitions with those 
of the main stakeholders of the offered 
transport services. If a customer needs to 
add up emissions from different providers, the 
customer may need to use TOCs and HOCs 
which all providers apply in a comparable and 
consistent way. 

Consider fleet compositions.

• If a carrier specialized in temperature-
controlled services runs a fleet of 40-tonne 
trucks, it is possible that there is not much 
differentiation within the services offered. In 
this case the carrier can establish and use 
a single emission intensity for the whole 
fleet, i.e. the whole fleet represents one TOC 
(“TOC of a specific vehicle type in multiple 
schedules.”)

• If a carrier fleet consists of different vehicle 
sizes offering different service types, the 
fleet specification needs to be adjusted 
accordingly (“TOC of a specified group of 
vehicles in multiple schedules”). Such vehicle 
groups may be split into further clusters, 
e.g. linehaul and last mile delivery, which still 
contain multiple schedules but each with 
similar emission intensities. If the services are 
not comparable and have different emission 
intensities, a further differentiation into 
separate TOCs is needed, such as local vs. 
regional, densely populated urban vs rural 
areas, etc.

Separate clusters for some customers. If 
a customer wants to know the impact on the 
emissions of the change of the energy source 
used for a transport service, the concerned 
group of vehicles in the specific (group of) 
schedule(s) needs to be clustered separately 
into a TOC (or HOC respectively). Then 
information about those specific transport 
services can be generated to understand 
the impact of such a change. (This would be 
particularly important for insetting projects.)

Distance clusters in air transport. There 
is no linear dependency of carbon intensity 
and the distance of a flight. Take-off and 
landing have a strong impact on aviation 
emissions and, therefore, TOCs must take into 
consideration distance clusters (short- and 
long-haul flights). The aircraft size (capacity) 
and type (freighter vs. passenger aircraft) 
are also relevant and therefore need to be 
considered as well. Finally, if Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel use is related to specified port 
pairs (chartered flights), the granularity level 
of the related TOC needs to be considered (“a 
specific vehicle type in a specific schedule.”)

Transport operations can never be split 
between two different TOCs, as each 
transport operation must be allocated to one 
specific TOC. On the other hand, a TOC can 
include different energy carriers for propulsion, 
or also different types of activity with different 
transport requirements, e.g. diesel and LNG 
vehicle operations can be combined. To 
facilitate transparency, the following types of 
TOC exist, and each TOC must be identified 
as one of them:
• TOC of freight only (general case)
• TOC of freight only with multi-temperature   
  vehicles
• TOC of vehicles with passenger vehicles  
  and freight (e.g. ferries)
• TOC of any other case

TOCs should reflect entire round trips 
made by the vehicles. The round trip does 
not require an immediate return to the point of 
origin, and it can include a group of sequential 
journeys that start and end at the same point. 
• Include all loaded as well as empty trips  
  which are part of the round trip to balance 
  out GHG emissions within asymmetric  
  transport flows. 
• Where empty containers or pallets are  
  transported on behalf of a transport service  
  purchaser, e.g. for relocation purposes, they 
  become a consignment in their own right.
• An exception is when a vehicle or vessel is   
  chartered for a one-way journey, which can  
  be specifically identified within the transport 
   operator’s network as well as in the  
  transport purchaser’s system.
• Pipelines are exempt from the round-trip  
  concept, due to the nature of their use and  
  infrastructure.

HOC factors. For the identification of a HOC, 
the factors that affect the scale, composition 
and characteristics of the operations carried 
out need to be taken into consideration, e.g.:
• Number and type of hub operations  
  contributing to the HOC, e.g. handling of  
  freight, (un)loading, (de)boarding, transport   
  on-site;
• Nature and consistency of the hub operations  
  included in the HOC, e.g. electrified or non-  
  electrified;
• Inbound and outbound transport mode and  
  relevance of intermodal change;
• Any processes essential for maintaining the  
  condition of the freight or ensuring passenger  
  health and safety;
• Nature of freight handled (e.g. palletized,  
  containerized, piece good);
• Additional, energy consuming and emission- 
  causing activities related to the operations,   
  e.g. temperature control, repackaging, etc.

Hub operations can never be split between 
two different HOCs, as each hub operation 
must be allocated to one specific HOC. A hub 
may perform hub operations that form part of 
a different HOC. (Further suggestions for the 
characteristics which can be used to establish 
HOCs can be found in Section 1 Chapter 
4 “Information and Requirements for the 
Individual Transport Modes and Hubs”)

Data categories 
and quality

The type of data used has a direct influence 
on the accuracy of the results, and therefore 
on the degree to which results can be used, 
to inform, analyze the efficiency of transport 
operations, track emission reduction actions, 
etc. It is therefore important to gather high-
quality, consistent data, and to specify the 
type of data and calculation approach used. 
Specific guidance on collecting high-quality 
data for transportation is provided by US EPA 
SmartWay.23

In line with ISO 14083, the following data 
categories are distinguished:
• Primary data
• Secondary data
- Modeled data 
- Default data

Primary data. Primary data is the “quantified 
value of a process or an activity from a direct 
measurement or a calculation based on direct 
measurements.”9 Good quality primary (actual) 
data is what should be used by a transport or 
logistics site operator to calculate its Scope 
1 GHG emissions. It is also the type of data 
transport buyers should aim to collect from 
carriers for their Scope 3 emissions accounting. 
Primary data can range from highly precise 
information, such as from fuel receipts or annual 
energy consumption spend, to aggregated values 
that reflect energy consumption or emission 
intensity for a year’s worth of vehicle movements.

Secondary data. Secondary data is all data that 
is not primary data. It can be differentiated into 
modeled data and default data.

Modeled data Modeled data is data which 
is established using a model “that takes into 
account primary data and/or GHG emission 
relevant parameters of a transport operation 
or hub operation.”10 Companies and tool 
providers model energy consumption and 
emissions using available information on types 
of goods consignment sizes, journey origin, 
destination and intermediate handling locations, 
and any information about the vehicles used, 
load factors, etc. The accuracy of the model’s 
outputs will depend on the level of detail that 
is available about the transport operation and 
the assumptions made, as well as the model’s 
algorithms. In general, assumptions that are 
made that rely on default data, rather than 
primary data, will increase the uncertainty of the 
output. It is important to ensure that the methods 
embedded into tools for modeling data are 
aligned with the GLEC Framework.

Default data. If no other data is available, the 
last resort is to use default data representative 
of average industry operating practices. 
Default data can provide a general indication of 
emissions, illuminating hotspots, and can offer 
a structure for prioritizing further data collection 
to improve accuracy. To help companies that are 
starting out on a journey to high quality logistics 
emissions calculations, Section 3 Module 2 of the 
Framework presents a wide range of default data 
with varying levels of precision that provides a 
general indication of emissions. Communication 
with suppliers can help to better understand the 
actual conditions to pick the most appropriate 

Primary 
Data 

Secondary 
Data 

Modeled 
Data 

Default

default factors. Specific information about the 
vehicle fleet, energy type, temperature control, 
topography, etc. can improve accuracy. The source 
of any default data used must be clearly specified.

The GLEC Framework is intended to align 
methodological aspects as far as is possible. GHG 
emission calculations rely not only upon a sound 
methodology but also good quality input data. 
The type of data used can influence the accuracy 
of the results, and the degree to which results can 
be used to inform and track emission reduction 
actions. Thus, it is important to specify the type of 
data and calculation approach used. 

It is recommended that companies consider 
appointing appropriately qualified, independent 
third-party entities to conduct assurance of the 
input data and any assumptions embedded within 

the calculation process. Though not required, 
third party assurance provides an independent 
assessment with the aim of establishing 
confidence or trust around a process and/or 
declared output.

To support this process, SFC has worked with 
GLEC members and consultees to develop an 
assurance scheme to accompany the GLEC 
Framework and ISO 14083. The purpose is to 
provide a common framework for transport 
operators, their customers and assurance 
providers to assess claims made about the 
adoption and implementation of and calculation 
outputs from the GLEC Framework. Details are 
available online at www.smartfreightcentre.org.

Calculation of the 
TCE emissions

Calculation of the activity of the TCE

To calculate the emissions of an individual 
TCE, you multiply the transport activity or 
hub operation activity by the GHG emission 
intensity of the related TOC or HOC 
respectively:

The approaches for transport activities and 
hub operation activities in this last step vary 

slightly, since the calculation of emissions 
of transport operation TCEs often requires 
a correction by a DAF. This DAF is needed 
when a different distance type is used for the 
distance of the quantification of the TCE’s 
transport activity and for the quantification of 
the emission intensity of the related TOC.

The GHG emissions of transport operations 
have two components: an energy provision 
component and an operation component. This 
allows the operation and energy provision 
emissions to be calculated separately. To 
obtain the total GHG emissions of the TCE, 
the GHG emissions of the transport operation 
and the GHG emission of the energy provision 
are added together.

Adding up of transport chains 
to networks and transport use 
of organizations

Similarly, if you want to calculate the 
emissions of an entire organization, you 
add all transport chains that constitute your 
network.

A transport chain’s total GHG emissions are 
calculated by adding the GHG emissions 
for each of the TCEs that comprise it. The 
GHG emissions of the vehicle operations, the 
vehicle energy provision allocated to each 
TCE, the hub equipment operations and the 
hub equipment energy provision allocated to 
the TCEs of the specific transport chain are 
added up to give the total.

Calculations such as these can be used for 
corporate reporting or for a defined subset 
of your business, by aggregating different 
transport chains and the relevant elements (i.e. 
transport and hub TCEs.) What is important, 
is that GHG emissions for each TCE are 
calculated individually first.

Chapter 3
Steps for Establishing 
the Emission Intensity 
of a TOC or a HOC

1

A TOC is a group of transport operations that share similar 
characteristics and a HOC is a group of hub operations that 
share similar characteristics, in a defined period, which is 
typically one calendar year unless specified otherwise and 
explained in the related reporting. Establishing the emission 
intensity for TOCs and HOCs therefore contributes to improving 
the transparency of the efficiency of your transport operations. 

General considerations regarding 
the establishing of emission 
intensity for a TOC or a HOC

For calculating a TCE’s GHG emissions, 
you need to establish the related TOC or 
HOC emission intensity (see also Chapter 3 
“Establishing the relevant TOC or HOC”).

The GHG emission intensity relates GHG 
emissions to the transport or hub operation 
activities that caused them. It can be 
expressed as:
• CO2e per tonne-kilometer (or equivalent  
  units) for transport
• CO2e per tonne throughput (or equivalent    
  units) for freight hub throughput

The following steps are required to establish a 
TOC’s or HOC’s emission intensity:

1. Establish the TOC’s or HOC’s activity data.
2. Establish the energy use, related emission 
factors and calculation of the GHG emissions 
of the TOC or HOC.
3. Calculate the emission intensity of the TOC 
or a HOC

Calculation of the

You can use the following forms of data for 
establishing the emission intensity of a TOC 
or HOC (see also Chapter 2: Info box Data 
Categories and Quality):
A. Using primary data
B. Calculating data with a model
C. Selecting a value from a database of 
default values
D. Collecting a value from a contracted 
operator that has used primary data (A) or 
modeled data (B)

For transparency and to obtain results that 
reflect the specific efficiency and emissions of 
a TOC or HOC, you should use primary data 
(option A) whenever possible. Especially as 
a transport or hub operator you should use 
primary data to maximize transparency on 
your operations. Where primary data is not 
available, modeled data (option B Calculating 
data with a model) should be prioritized over 
default values (option C Selecting a value 
from a database of default values). It is very 
common that a combination of the different 
types of data is needed as primary data is not 
always available. In all cases it is important 
that the data is representative and of the 
highest possible accuracy for the TOC or 
HOC and the purpose for which it is used.

Data sources 
for calculating 
emission 
intensities

A. Using primary data
When using primary data, the following 
steps must be carried out:
1. All transport and hub operations that 
are performed and are related to the GHG 
emission quantification need to be identified.
2. The TOCs and HOCs for these operations 
must be established.
3. For each TOC and HOC the GHG activity 
data from each GHG source (quantity of 
energy consumed, refrigerant leakage, etc.) 
must be identified, quantified and converted 
to GHG emissions; the sum of all the GHG 
sources equals the GHG emissions for 
the TOC or HOC. Then the corresponding 
transport or hub operation activity for the 
TOC or HOC are calculated, and finally the 
GHG emission intensity for the TOC or HOC.
For a detailed description of the mode-
specific quantification actions at TOC 
or HOC level see Section 1 Chapter 4 
“Information and Requirements for 
Individual Transport Modes and Hubs.”

B. Calculating data with a model
You can find detailed information on 
calculating GHG emission intensities by 
means of a model in Section 3 Module 
2 “Default Energy Efficiency and CO2e 
Intensity.”

C. Selecting a value from a database 
of default values
Where default data needs to be used, 
the data chosen must have the closest 
match between the default GHG emission 
classification and the characteristics of the 
TOC or HOC concerned. If no clear match 
can be identified, the sources used to fill 
the gap and the reasons for their choice 
must be fully documented (Section 2 
Chapter 1 “Reporting Emissions.”)

D. Collecting a value from a contracted 
operator that has used primary data (A) 
or modeled data (B)
GHG emission intensity values may also 
be collected from contracted operators 
that have applied option A Using primary 
data preferably or alternatively option B

To establish the emission intensity of a TOC 
for a given period (usually one calendar 
year), first, you need to identify the transport 
activity of this TOC. The second step is to 
generate the emission intensity. Generally, 
the freight transport activity of a TOC is 
calculated by: 
• multiplying the mass of each consignment   
  with its specific transport activity distance
• adding up all the results of above   
  multiplication for each shipment of the 
  TOC  during a given period (usually one  
  calendar year).

(see also Info box “Demonstration of tonne-
kilometer (tkm) calculation approaches”.)

Where a TOC has different temperature 
zones, even within one vehicle, you must 
calculate a freight transport activity for 
each temperature condition separately. 
Therefore, the freight transport activity per 
temperature condition is calculated first, 
before adding the transport activities of the 
different temperature conditions to build the 
transport activity of the specific TOC.

Establishing transport activity 
for a TOC for combined 
passenger and freight transport

In the case of a TOC of vehicles or vessels 
that combine passenger and freight transport, 
whether they include passenger vehicles or 
not, the calculation of the transport activity 
can be done in the following steps:
1. Each relevant type of sub-category to the 
TOC needs to be identified, e.g. passengers 
with their luggage, cars, motorcycles, empty 
trailers, loaded trailers.
2. If possible, also here you should use 
primary data in the form of actual mass of 
passengers and vehicles. Where this is not 
possible, you can apply the conventionally 
used equivalent of 100kg per passenger, 
including baggage. Similarly, default values 

for different vehicles can be used where their 
specific mass is not available. (For more detail 
see Section 1 Chapter 4 “Information and 
Requirements for the Individual Transport 
Modes and Hubs.”)
3. For each sub-category identified, the 
transport activity distance needs to be 
multiplied by the number of entities of that 
specific type, e.g. number of passengers 
multiplied by number of the related transport 
activity data. The result equals the transport 
activity of this specific type of entity.
4. Finally, the transport activities of all types of 
entity are added and comprises the transport 
activity of the combined transport.

particular 8.4.4. Transport activity of a TOC of freight – General case,

Establishing the operation activity 
for a HOC

When establishing the emission intensity of 
a HOC, the approach is similar to the one 
described for TOCs. It is particularly important 
to include the total consumption of each 
energy carrier and refrigerant. In the case of 
different hub operation activities that generate 
GHG emissions, activity data for each of these 
hub operation activities must be quantified 
separately. Once you have established the 
activity data of the individual hub operations, 
their sum comprises the activity data of the 
entire HOC. 

Similarly, where hub operations are not 
homogeneous and different sub-categories 
of hub operations can be distinguished, e.g. 
due to different temperatures in temperature-
controlled operations or due to combined 
freight or passengers operations within a HOC, 
a two-step process is needed. First you need 
to establish the corresponding hub operation 
activity data per specific sub-category of the 
operation, then calculate individual emission 
intensify for each of these activities. 
Section 1 Chapter 4 “Information and 
Requirements for the Individual Transport 
Modes and Hubs” gives guidance for allocating 
GHG activity data for a HOC.

Attention: Refrigerant refills at vehicle or 
load unit level (e.g. reefer containers) are 
not part of hub emissions, as these are 
considered as a form of GHG activity for 
the corresponding TOC.

Calculation of the GHG emissions of a TOC

For the calculation of GHG emissions for a 
TOC, it must be identified as fitting into one of 
two categories:
• The transport operations carried out are near 
  identical or at least show similar    
  characteristics for all consignments and no  
  passenger transport is included in the TOC
• The transport operations carried out to  
  the consignments differ and/or passenger    
  transport is part of the TOC.

In the first case, where the transport operations 
applied show similar characteristics for all 
consignments, you can calculate the GHG 
emissions for all operations of the TOC jointly. 
In the second case, where different transport 
operations are carried out on the consignments 
and/or passenger transport within the TOC, 
you need to calculate the emissions for each 
specific transport activity, i.e. for each sub-
category, separately. 

For example, if a transport includes 
temperature-controlled operations and non-
temperature-controlled operations, which in all 
other respects are similar, you must calculate 
two different GHG emissions for the TOC, as 
well as two different transport activity energy 
provision GHG emissions: one for the non-
temperature-controlled vehicle operations 
of the TOC and one for the temperature-
controlled vehicle operations. Similarly, for 
a ferry, you must establish the emissions for 
passengers and freight separately.

ISO References: 8.3 Calculation of GHG emissions of a TOC

You calculate the GHG emissions of a specific 
transport operation of a TOC by multiplying 
that transport activity and the related emission 
factor of the TOC.

Steps for Establishing 
the Emission Intensity 
of a TOC or a HOC

1

Calculation of the GHG emissions of a HOC

Similarly, for the calculation of GHG emissions 
for a HOC, it must be identified as fitting into 
one of two categories:
• The hub operations carried out are near  
  identical or at least show similar    
  characteristics for all consignments and no  
  passenger transport is included in the HOC
• The hub operations carried out to the  
  consignments differ (e.g. different  
  temperature conditions apply) and/or  
  passenger transport is part of the TOC

In the first case, if the operations carried out 
within the HOC are homogeneous, you can 
calculate the emissions of the HOC for all 
operations jointly. In the second case, you 
must differentiate individual types of activities 
and calculate the emissions for the operations 
applied to the freight and for the operations 
applied to the passengers separately. For 
hub operations with different temperature 
conditions, you must establish GHG emissions 
and GHG emission intensities separately for 
each temperature condition.

You calculate GHG emissions for the hub 
operation activities by multiplying the quantity 
of the specific hub operation activity by the 
related GHG emission factor for the specific 
hub operation.

Once the GHG emissions of all hub operation activities of 
the HOC have been calculated and the GHG emissions 
of the energy provision of all these hub operation 
activities of the HOC are established, the sum of them 
constitutes the total GHG emissions of the HOC:

GHG emissions

To establish the GHG emissions related to

hub operation activity by the related energy 
provision GHG emission factor:

Global aviation, encompassing both domestic and international 
operations for both passenger and freight transport, contributes to 
approximately 1.9% of total GHG emissions.24 Air transport has a 
unique interaction with the climate because the majority of emissions 
occur at cruising altitudes of 8‒12 km.25 The IPCC notes that high 
altitude deposition of not only CO2, but also NOx, methane, water 
vapor and ozone, contributes a climate warming impact, and can also 
seed clouds that trap heat from the earth’s surface (radiative forcing).26

Aviation is the most emission-intensive mode of transportation. 
Most aviation emissions come from passenger transport, 
with freight comprising around 19% of total aviation related 
emissions.27 That said, aviation is expected to be one of the 
fastest growing modes of transport in the coming years, with a 
projected annual growth rate of around 3% until 2040.28 Between 
2009 and 2017 the energy efficiency of aviation improved 
by 17%.29

Reductions in air freight emissions are 
possible through more efficient aircraft 
concepts and engines, use of renewable 
fuels with a lower lifecycle impact (often 
referred to as SAFs), improved air traffic 
management and other optimization 
measures.30,31 However, achieving aviation 
decarbonization will be a challenge without 
a radical new aircraft engine technology. 
The lack of ready technologies has led the 
International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) to put forth the Carbon Offsetting 
and Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA), which uses carbon 
offsets to mitigate climate impacts until new 
technologies are available.32

Scope

The GLEC Framework covers freight transport 
by any type of aircraft, including freighters and 
passenger aircraft carrying cargo in their hold 
(“belly cargo or freight.”) When assessing the 
emissions generated by air freight, the GLEC 
Framework takes into account the complete 
flight cycle of both cargo and passenger 
aircraft. This includes considering various 
activities such as taxiing, take-off, cruising 
and landing, as well as any other movements 
associated with the loading and unloading 
of freight. Neither the embedded emissions 
of producing the aircraft themselves, nor the 
emissions related to airline or airport staff, are 
included in the GHG emission calculation for 
air freight transport. Also currently excluded 
are any additional global warming impacts 

from the combustion of aviation fuels at  
high altitude.

The services provided by the air terminal (e.g., 
loading, unloading, cleaning, block power) are 
classified under logistics sites.

Transport Operations Categories (TOCs)

In air freight transport chains, the air transport 
usually is the mainhaul (see Figure 1).
For air transport, suitable factors to structure 
TOCs include distance, which can be 
categorized as short (< 1 500 km) or long (> 1 
500 km), and plane configuration, which can 
be a dedicated freight aircraft or a passenger 
aircraft with belly freight. Finer granularity 
levels for defining air transport TOCs can be:

• A single aircraft or aircraft type on a single   
  schedule: e.g., a B777-F flying FRA –  
  NYK – FRA
• A single aircraft or aircraft type in a multiple  
  schedule: e.g., a (group of) B777-F flying 
  destinations between Europe and North 
  America
• A group of aircrafts (same aircraft type,  
  mixed aircraft types) in a single schedule:    
  e.g., all freighters or all aircrafts flying FRA –  
  NYK ‒ FRA
• A group of aircrafts (same aircraft type,  
  mixed aircraft types) in multiple schedules: 
  e.g., all freighter or all aircrafts flying 
  destinations between Europe and  
  North America

IATA RP167833 and RP172634

• IATA has updated its emission calculation    
  Guideline IATA RP1678 for freight and added  
  a “Passenger CO2 Standard Methodology” in  
  2022 (IATA RP1726).
• IATA’s network-based approach is in line with  
  the transport operation category approach.
• IATA allows emissions to be calculated on a  
  weight or volume basis; for alignment with   
  the GLEC Framework, weight should 
  be used.
• The allocation rule between passenger and  
  belly freight (IATA RP1726) is in line with ISO  
  14083 and only mass balanced.

CORSIA32

• The Monitoring, Reporting and Verification   
  (MRV) procedures for CORSIA include the  
  WTW approach for calculating emissions  
  from aviation fuel. This requires airlines to 
  report the carbon intensity of their  
  aviation fuel.
• The “CORSIA Methodology for Calculating   
  Actual Life Cycle Emissions Values” provides  
  for all greenhouse gases (CO2e) related to    
  biogenic and fossil energy sources.

• CORSIA requires airlines to report their  
  emissions based on a standard methodology  
  for calculating CO2e emissions from aviation  
  fuel. This methodology is based on the ICAO  
  Carbon Emissions Calculator,35 which takes  
  into account factors such as energy source,  
  aircraft type and flight distance.
• CORSIA values must be scaled from CO2 
  to CO2e.
• CORSIA does not specify use of fuel life  
  cycle for fossil kerosene. 

Under CORSIA, airlines are required to offset 
any emissions above the 2020 baseline 
through the purchase of carbon credits from 
approved emission reduction projects. The 
scheme is being phased in since 2021, with a 
voluntary phase from 2021 to 2026, followed 
by a mandatory phase from 2027 to 2035 for 
most countries.36

For emission factors you can refer to Section 3 
Module 1 indicated factors for Jet A/A1 fuel in 
the regions North America and Europe.

Methodology alignment

The GLEC Framework’s approach of 
allocating freight emissions of air transport 
by mass is fully compatible with the 
International Air Transport Association’s 
(IATA) Recommended Practice 1678, the US 
EPA’s 2018 SmartWay Air Carrier Partner 
Tool15 and ICAO’s CORSIA program.

Requirements for air  
transport calculations

Consignment mass 

Use the actual consignment mass, 
not proxies like chargeable weight.

Distance

• Distance is measured as the GCD
   between the origin and destination airport 
  for each flight leg.
• If the actual distance is used in the 
  calculation, you need to apply a DAF to  
  prevent underreporting. The DAF must be 
   calculated on best available data regarding  
  maneuvering, taxiing and other deviations, 
   and needs to be disclosed alongside the 
   provided values in the reporting. In case  
  the specific information for the DAF is not 
  available, you use the ratio of (GCD + 95km)  
  / GCD 
  In this case, the 95km represent the  
  difference between the actual distance  
  and the transport activity distance due to    
  maneuvering etc.;
• The latitude and longitude of the origin 
  and destination can be taken either from  
  aerodrome data published in the national    
  Aeronautic Information Publication or from a  
  source using such data (e.g., ICAO).
• If intermediate stops are made, distance  
  and associated emissions should be  
  calculated separately, because each leg in 
   the overall journey counts as a TCE, and  
  then added to give the totals.

• For Scope 3 calculations, it can be difficult 
   to know whether there were any intermediate  
  stops on the flight path. If distance is taken  
  between origin and destination, not including  
  intermediate stops, this will lead to systemic  
  underestimation of distance and emissions.  
  Therefore, you should aim to obtain the  
  flight numbers for each journey, as this is the  
  most reliable approach, even if getting this   
  information can be complex.

Default factors

• The GLEC Framework provides the following  
  air transport energy efficiency and emission  
  intensity (see Section 3 Module 2 Default    
  Energy Efficiency and CO2e Intensity Factors  
  for more information):
- The overall IATA industry average.
- A matrix showing notional short- and  
  long-haul values for passenger planes and 
   freighters, as well as an average value  
  that can be used when the nature of the air  
  transport is unknown.
• If flights include intermediate stops, you  
  should apply the appropriate default 
  factor for each flight leg’s origin and  
  destination points.

Energy source

• Jet fuel A (kerosene) is the assumed  
  energy source for air transport.
• Aviation gas is also used in some cases,  
  such as for aircraft with piston engines.
• If there is reason to believe another  
  energy source is used, i.e., through 
   detailed knowledge of aircraft type, select    
  the appropriate CO2e emission factor and    
  document the change.

Transport activity for passenger 
aircraft with belly freight

• In the case of TOCs in which the main  
  function is passenger transportation  
  with belly freight, apply the ISO provisions 
   on combined transport of freight and  
  passengers for calculation of transport  
  activity (see also Chapter 3 Calculation Steps  
  “Establishing transport activity for a TOC for  
  combined passenger and freight transport”.)
• To consider freight and passenger transport  
  together, two options are available:
  - The first option is based on mass and 
   uses the total passenger mass, including 
  baggage, and actual freight mass for  
  both allocation and calculation of GHG  
  emission intensity. 
- The second option is only for use in 
  situations when data needed for the first  
  option is not available. In this case you 
  convert the cargo mass into passenger 
  equivalents using a conversion value 
  of 100kg = 1 passenger equivalent and 
  then allocate the emissions according to 
  proportional share the total number of share 
  of passengers and passenger equivalents.
  The emission intensity can then be 
  calculated using the known cargo mass 
  combined with the transport activity distance.
• The mass of passengers encompasses  
  every individual passenger and their  
  accompanying baggage; the mass of  
  freight comprises the mass of the freight  
  itself and the mass of packaging provided   
  by the organization sending the shipment.  
  Any additional transport packaging, pallets,  
  or containers used specifically for the  
  transport operation is excluded.

Cable Cars

Global impact

Cable cars are transportation systems for people, freight or 
both combined. Cable cars exist in the form of suspended air 
ropeways or surface bound ropeways. Whereas air ropeways 
usually have cabins or buckets for the transport of passenger and 
freight suspended from a cable, surface ropeways are funiculars 
or bucket systems equipped with either wheels or rails.

In all cable cars, the movement is generated 
by a cable or rope that pulls the transporting 
unit. The cables are typically powered by an 
electric motor, and the gondolas or buckets 
can either be fixed to the cables or detachable, 
depending on the system. They are often used 
in mountainous or difficult-to-access terrain. 
In urban areas, cable car systems for both 
freight and passenger transport are used with 
positive environmental and social impacts (e.g., 
Medellin, Columbia or Graz, Austria).37 The 
dual use of the system as used in e.g., Graz 
generates synergies such as the bundling of 
traffic and avoidance of unnecessary journeys 
and displacement effects. Cable car stations 
can serve as multifunctional operating points 
for both freight logistics and passenger traffic.

The GHG emissions of cable cars vary 
depending on several factors, such as the 
type of cable car system, the energy source 
used to power the system, and the volume 
and weight of the materials being transported. 
If a cable car system is powered by electricity 
generated from renewable sources such as 
hydroelectric, wind or solar power, the GHG 
emissions will be significantly lower than if the 
system is powered by fossil-fuel energy.

Currently, there is a scarcity of studies 
focusing specifically on the GHG emissions 
of cable cars, in particular cable cars used for 
freight or combined transport. Therefore, the 
environmental impact of cable cars needs to 
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into account the specific context, energy 
source and conditions of each system.

Scope

The content of this section is applicable to all 
cable car systems that consume energy and 
are primarily used for the transportation of 
freight. Regardless of whether the cable car 
system consists of multiple vehicles or a single 
wagon only, it must be viewed as a unified 
transport system, including its infrastructure. 
Vehicles that move on cables, but without the 
transmission of movement through at least one 
cable, do not fall under the definition of cable 
cars. Similarly, vertical elevators are excluded 
from the definition of cable cars.

Transport Operation Categories (TOCs)

Aerial cable cars can be further divided into 
three types:
1. Unidirectional Monocable: this system uses a 
single cable to transport goods in one direction. 
The cable is supported by towers and driven 
by a motor located at one end of the cable 
car line. Goods are loaded onto fixed-grip or 
detachable-grip buckets that travel along the 
cable. 
2. Unidirectional bi-cable: this system uses 
two cables, with the cabins or containers 
attached to one of the cables by means of a 
grip or carrier. The cables are driven by motors 
at opposite ends of the cable car route, and 
the cabins or containers move in one direction 
along the cables. This system can be further 
divided into the variations Material 2S and 
Material 3S, differing in how the cabins or 
containers are attached to the cables and the 
configuration of the cables themselves.

3. Reversible bi-cable (Jigback): this system 
uses two separate cables that run parallel 
to each other. The cabins or containers are 
attached to the cables by means of detachable 
carriers, and the cables are driven by motors at 
opposite ends of the cable car route. 

Methodology alignment

When evaluating the GHG emissions of cable 
cars used for freight transport, it is possible to 
use either primary measured data or secondary 
modeled data. Often, a combination of the two 
is necessary and used. 

Requirements for cable car 
transport calculations 

Distance

•  The transport activity distance should be 
  based on the SFD and usually no DAF is 
  required, as the route of the cabins or 
   buckets is defined by the ropes of their  
  system and deviations are impossible.
•  If two or more cable cars are linked to each   
  other to one transport system, each of the    
  constituting sections shall be considered as 
  one cable car, even if they ensure the  
  continuity of the travel of the vehicle  
  they connect.

modes and hubs

Hubs

Global impact

Hubs are locations where passengers and/or freight is handled from one 
vehicle or transport mode to another before, after or between different 
transport operations of a transport chain.9  Hubs for freight, also known 
as “logistics hubs”, are a vital backbone to supply chains. Logistics 
hubs are where freight is stored and processed, and where myriad forms 
of transport intersect. Logistics hubs are often close to populations, 
emphasizing the importance of both the climate and health impacts of 
their activities. Given their integral role in the booming logistics sector, 
their impact is only expected to grow in the coming years. Thus, it will be 
all the more important in the future to align other phases of the life cycle 
of logistics hubs with sustainability topics in addition to operation.38 

Logistics hubs are a diverse group of facilities scattered around 
the globe; their collective impact is not well-understood. The World 
Economic Forum estimated that warehouse and sorting facilities 
alone can comprise up to 13% of supply chain emissions.39 

Country-specific evaluations have shown that warehouse emissions 
account for around 20% of the transport emissions in the United 
States, while in the UK, it is assumed that they account for 11% 
to 30%.40 For Germany, about 15% of transport emissions were 
assigned to logistics hubs.41

A company’s use of logistics hubs, and the 
subsequent emissions arising from operation, 
will vary based on the modes of transport, 
refrigeration needs and region. Therefore, the 
relative impact of emissions from logistics 
hubs will vary by company and product and 
should be assessed accordingly in order to 
create transparency about the performance of 
logistics hubs in a first step and to understand 
other overarching interdependencies in  
subsequent steps. This includes, for example, 
the continuous evaluation of measures that can 
reduce the environmental impact of hubs.

Scope

Logistics hubs are the nodes, sites, facilities, 
centers and depots that connect transport 
legs (within and between corresponding 
transport modes) or are the start or end point 
of a transport chain.42 Examples for logistics 
hubs are facilities such as warehouses, 
consolidation/fulfilment centers, distribution 
centers, and cross-docking sites or micro 
depots/city hubs as well terminals at maritime 
or inland ports, freight and intermodal terminals 
or cargo terminals at airports. Logistics hubs 
consist of own transport chain elements 
(TCE). So the boundary for emissions from 
logistics hubs begins when the consignment is 
unloaded from the inbound vehicle or vessel, 
and ends when the freight is either handed over 
to the recipient or reloaded onto the outbound 
vehicle or vessel. 

While the consideration of transshipment 
processes according to ISO 14083 is 
mandatory, the consideration of storage or 

repacking of cargo is optional, as are emissions 
related to information and communications 
technology (ICT) equipment and data servers 
provided by external server providers. If any 
of these processes (warehousing, (re)packing, 
external server providers) are taken into 
account, this shall be noted accordingly.9

The GLEC Framework considers emissions from 
logistics hubs as those emitted by the fuel and 
electricity used to unload/load or move freight 
at the hub, and direct losses of refrigerants used 
in temperature control equipment. This includes 
energy used for onsite vehicles, technical 
equipment for handling freight, lighting, heating/
cooling (for facilities and reefers), weigh 
stations, onsite server rooms and administrative 
facilities related to freight movement at the hub, 
and other freight-related activities. Emissions 
linked to energy supply for onsite vehicles and 
machinery such as cranes, reach stackers, fork-
lift trucks, shuttles that transport employees 
onsite, diesel generators and shore power to 
vessels are included. The energy and refrigerant 
use of inbound and outbound transport to or 
from the hub is not included in the logistics 
hubs’ emissions, those are covered by the 
corresponding transport TCE. The upstream 
emissions related to infrastructure, vehicles 
and material handling equipment are not 
included, nor are Scope 3 emissions resulting 
from employee commuting and business travel. 
Emissions related to self-driving cargo, e.g. in 
roll on, roll off (RoRo) terminals are not included 
in logistics hubs’ emissions.

In order to manage this variety, structuring can 
be made using so-called HOCs categories 

40

(HOCs), which take into account different levels 
of granularity on the one hand, e.g. HOC of a 
single hub or specific hub types in the network, 
and factors that affect the scale, composition 
and characteristics of the operations carried 
out on the other. Thus, any single hub operation 
shall always be considered in the context of the 
overall system in which it takes place. Finally, 
a HOC is the summary of hub operations with 
similar characteristics in a defined time period 
(up to one year).

HOCs

Recommended clusters for HOC are  
based on9
•  Processes: freight transshipment only, 
  passenger transfer only, combined 
   passenger/freight transfer, freight    
  transshipment and storage
•  freight types: average/mixed, containerized 
  or swap bodies, palletized, break bulk/ 
  piece goods, dry bulk, liquid bulk, vehicle  
  transport, other and 
•  conditions: ambient, temperature controlled

Methodology alignment

The Fraunhofer IML “Guide for Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions Accounting at Logistics Hubs” 
provides detailed instructions on accounting for 
logistics hubs.40 The method was developed 
jointly in collaboration with SFC and EcoTransIT 
World, adapted to ISO 14083 and informed this 
version of the Framework.

Requirements for logistics

Shipment mass

Activity data for logistics hubs is calculated 
based on the cumulative annual tonnes 
throughput of shipments leaving the center, 
i.e. outbound freight. It may be useful to also 
track the number of tonnes requiring special 
treatment, such as temperature control (e.g. 
cooling or heating). Such differentiation allows 
you to allocate emissions accordingly. 
Hubs dealing primarily with containerized cargo 
may need to convert TEU to tonnes if shipment 
mass is not available. An average value of 10 
tonnes per TEU can be used. Alternatively, 
a value of 6 tonnes per TEU may be used 
for lightweight cargo or 14.5 tonnes per TEU 
for heavyweight cargo if the use of these 
categories can be justified. 

For post and parcel operations, where 
knowledge of individual items’ mass is limited, 
the quantity of freight may be the number 
of items. 

allocate GHG emissions considering specific 
characteristics. When handling involves 
ambient and refrigerated freight at a hub, 
the energy consumption for cooling, and 
the leakage of refrigerants, allocate overall 
emissions between these two characteristics. 
In some cases, it may be difficult to split 
electricity and fuel consumption for freight and 
non-freight related activities. In these cases, 
logistics hub operators are encouraged to 
make these calculations based on the best 
available information and transparently record 
any potential anomalies when reporting. 
For logistics hubs that are operated jointly by 
more than one operator, allocation of emissions 
should be based on the throughput tonnage by 
each operator separately.

Further allocation may be necessary if 
corresponding separate data acquisition is not 
possible. 

The selected allocation principles shall remain 
constant over time and shall be documented 
transparently, e.g. using the amount of freight 
to allocate electricity consumption for lighting 
to specific functional areas.

Time period

Default values

Still a developing area, default values for 
logistics hubs have been historically difficult 
to obtain. Furthermore, logistics hubs are 
extremely diverse in their nature. Container 
terminals are very different from transshipment 
hubs, but even within each category of 
logistics hubs very different services can 
be found.38 Fraunhofer IML has advanced 
the understanding of average logistics hub 
emission intensity values through extensive 
industry research and data collection with 
the help of the REff Tool®.43 This version 
of the Framework benefits from their 
research, offering a set of default values 
for transshipment sites, warehouses and 
terminals considering ambient freight as 
well as temperature controlled handling. The 
default values are included in Module 2. 

For these values, electricity, heating energy, 
or other fuels and refrigerants are already 
converted to CO2e using corresponding 
regional emission factors where available and 
are aggregated on a global level. While data 
on terminals originate from various regions 
worldwide, the main source for warehouses 
and transshipment sites is currently Europe.  

Wherever possible, allocation should be 
avoided by more detailed data gathering. 
You might not have access to detailed hub 
operations activity in cases when multiple 
services with different characteristics are 
fulfilled by a hub. In those cases, you can 

The operational data for hubs should be 
aggregated over periods of up to one year. This 
is to remove seasonal fluctuations resulting e.g. 
from heating or lighting, or any transient impact 
on long-term trends.

Inland waterways

Global impact

Freight transport by inland waterways comprises a relatively 
small share of the logistics sector. With approximately 50% lower 
energy consumption per tonne-kilometer of freight compared to 
road transport, it is on a par with rail transport in terms of energy 
efficiency. Due to its relatively low carbon emission intensity and role 
in reducing road congestion, inland waterways are seen as a beneficial 
option. Furthermore, inland waterways guarantee a high level of 
safety, particularly when it comes to the delivery of dangerous goods. 
Despite these benefits, inland waterway transport has experienced 
less growth and infrastructure investment than other modes, especially 
in developing countries.44 A boost to the investment in technologies 
for inland waterway operations could come about in the coming years, 
as the European Union has set a goal of increasing transport by inland 
waterways and short sea shipping by 25% by 2030 and by 50% by 
2050, compared to 2015.45

Energy use and emissions information for 
inland waterway transportation is often 
grouped with other modes of water transport in 
statistical publications, making it hard to isolate 
trends.46 Nevertheless, the GLEC Framework 
default values suggest that, depending on the 
vehicle or vessel used, inland waterways can 
offer a low energy, low emission alternative 
particularly for medium and long-distance 
transport.

Further improvements of efficiency of inland 
waterway transport can be gained through 
slow-steaming and optimized logistics 
operations. Energy-efficient power and 
propulsion systems, streamlined hulls and 
superstructures, and alternative energy 
sources, such as biodiesel, electricity or 
hydrogen, present practical near-term 
solutions.47 A few cutting-edge propulsion 
technologies, such as fuel cell hybrid drive 
systems, may also soon be on the market.48

Scope

Inland waterway transport refers to freight 
movement along stretches of water that are 
not part of the sea, such as rivers, lakes, 
canals and estuaries.49 The GLEC Framework 
v3 includes, like ISO 14083, all types of inland 
waterway vessels including barges, coupled 
convoys, pushed convoys, tankers and 
container vessels. Freight types considered are 
dry and bulk, containerized freight, and mass 
and volume-limited general freight.

Emissions to be considered are linked to the 
consumption of energy for the propulsion of 
the vessel, as well as maintenance of freight in 

the condition and at the temperatures required 
by the owner of the goods. All emissions 
related to the movement of freight, including 
empty backhauls and repositioning, should be 
included. Moreover, any energy that is supplied 
from shore, including in particular electrical 
energy, should be included in the vessel 
operator’s activity data. 

Emissions related to buildings and equipment 
used to load or unload cargo are classified 
under logistics sites and included in the 
HOC  emissions. 

TOCs

To cluster transport services with similar 
emission intensities, it is recommended 
to structure the TOCs based on a suitable 
combination of influencing factors for inland 
waterway freight transport, based on factors 
such as vessel size category, vessel size 
category and configuration, condition and 
waterway type:9

Freight type
•  Dry bulk
•  Liquid bulk
• Containerized
• Mass-limited, general freight
• Volume-limited, general freight

Vessel size category
• < 50 m
•  50 m to 80 m
• 80 m to 110 m
•  110 m to 135 m
• >135 m

  of reporting.

Requirements for inland 
waterway transport calculations

In general, inland waterway emissions 
accounting follows the principles developed 
by the maritime sector. The GLEC Framework 
is in alignment with the principles of the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
Energy Efficiency Operation Index (EEOI) 
guidelines and the US EPA SmartWay Barge 
Carrier Tool.

Shipment mass

• Use actual mass of freight.
• For containerized transport, an alternative 
   parameter such as TEU may be used in 
  place of the mass of freight (See also  
  SECTION 1 Chapter 2 Calculation Steps). 

  to little opportunity for deviation between  
  the actual distance and the SFD. Therefore, 
  you do not have to apply a DAF. 
• Appropriate distance calculators can be used  
  to help identify inland waterway distances as  
  accurately as possible.
• Convert (nautical) miles to kilometers using   
  factors in Annex 4 Unit Conversions.

Water current effects 

• For inland waterway transport operations,  
  water direction (i.e., whether with or against   
  the current) can have an important impact on  
  energy consumption. 
• Any calculation of emissions shall be applied  
  on a round-trip basis to average this impact  
  across the transport operations.

Default factors

• Smart Freight Centre and STC-Nestra  
  worked collaboratively with GLEC members  
  to develop a new set of industry-reviewed    
  default factors that accurately represent  
  today’s inland waterway sector.16
• Whilst we would always encourage you to    
  use carrier-specific values, the default values  
  in Module 2 provide a significant step forward  
  in terms of collecting and sharing consistent  
  data for a wide range of inland waterway  
  vessel types.

IMO EEOI17

• IMO EEOI emission results are expressed  
  as TTW, CO2; therefore, the WTT emissions 
  must be added and the result must be scaled  
  to a CO2e basis for alignment with the  
  GLEC Framework.

• SmartWay Barge Carrier Tool15
• SmartWay emission results are expressed  
  as TTW, CO2; therefore, the WTT emissions  
  must be added and the result must be scaled  
  to a CO2e basis for alignment with the GLEC  
  Framework.

Distance

Energy sources

• The ideal distance data is taken from the  
  vessel’s log book.
• Other options may include distance planning  
  software, telematics data or other sources of  
  network distance data.
• In cases where actual distance is not  
  available, distance for inland waterway  
  transport should be either the SFD, taking into  
  account the inland waterway network, or  
  the GCD.
• The limited number of route options available  
  within the inland waterway network leads  

• Marine diesel oil is the assumed energy 
  source for inland waterway transport  
  operations.
• Other potential energy sources include 
  other diesel oils, liquefied natural gas (LNG)   
  and biodiesel.

  source is used, i.e., through knowledge  
  of operations, select the appropriate CO2e    
  emissions factor and document the deviation.

Pipelines

Global impact

Pipeline transport involves the movement of a medium, such as 
liquid, gas, liquefied gas or slurry, through a system of pipes from 
one location to another. Pipelines provide an important mode 
of transportation for specific elements of the freight transport 
industry and are composed of long tubes made of steel or plastic 
and are used for transporting liquids or gases over long distances 
with high efficiency and low environmental impact. Pipelines can 
be either underground or above ground, and their diameter can vary 
from a few centimeters to several meters, depending on the volume of 
the product being transported.

Pipelines can transport large volumes over very 
long distances, which makes them ideal for 
products such as oil, gas and water. Pipelines 
are used extensively in the oil and gas industry, 
where they are used to transport crude oil, 
refined petroleum products and natural gas 
from the production site to refineries and 
distribution centers. In addition to the oil and 
gas industry, pipelines are also used in the 
chemical industry to transport chemicals such 
as chlorine and ammonia.

There are two aspects to consider when 
assessing the environmental impacts of 
pipelines: construction and operation. Studies 
have shown that the construction phase has a 
greater impact on the ecology of the affected 

area.50 This is because building a pipeline 
causes disruption to the area, including clearing 
away plants, digging, compressing soil and 
other activities. Moreover, since pipelines are 
usually constructed in a straight line, they can 
affect different natural and climatic zones with 
diverse geological and hydrological features. 

However, the operation of pipelines is not 
without its challenges either. One of the main 
challenges is to ensure the safety of the 
pipeline, which requires regular maintenance 
and inspection to prevent leaks and other 
accidents. As per the US EPA, methane 
leaks from gas pipelines were responsible for 
emitting approximately 21 million metric tons of 
CO2 equivalent in 2020.51 Additionally, the cost 

of building and maintaining pipelines can be 
high, which may limit their use in some areas.

Scope

•  When calculating GHG emissions from 
   pipeline operations, the operational  
  calculation is based on the energy used by 
  the equipment within the pipeline network  
  to move the product and maintain the  
  relevant pressure level. Furthermore, direct  
  fugitive GHG emissions from delivery  
  systems, such as flanges, valves, unions 
   and threaded connections, must also be  
  taken into account.
•  When comparing pipeline transport with 
   other modes of transport, you should
   include the differential compression, cooling  
  or heating processes, and their energy use 
   and related GHG emissions in the comparison. 
•  The initial compression of the medium 
  and pumping needed for feeding the  
  pipeline, located at the production site or  
  at transshipment point/terminal within the 
  transport chain, should be excluded from  
  the GHG emissions calculation of pipeline 
  transport and allocated to the hub via the 
  HOC calculation.
•  When considering a TCE that involves  
  pipeline transport, it is recommended that   
  you define the TOC for pipelines based on 
   the activity of the relevant  pipeline section  
  or network for all operations and mediums 
  transported over the course of one year. 
•  The system boundaries of ISO 14083 require  
  that multiple operational processes which 
  contribute to GHG emissions through 
  combustion or leakage, such as the vehicle  
  and hub operational processes, as well as 

  the processes involved in providing energy  
  to the vehicles and hub equipment, are  
  considered when quantifying GHG emissions 
  for a transportation chain. The implication of 
  this for pipeline transportation is that you 
   also need to include additional processes    
  such as start-up and idling of pipelines and  
  cleaning and flushing operations required 
   for pipeline maintenance. 
•  In the case of slurry pipelines, the allocation  
  or assignment of freight mass should not    
  include the weight of the transport medium,  
  such as water.

Requirements for pipeline 
transport calculations

Mass

In addition to the quantity of freight expressed 
in mass, you can use other parameters, 
e.g., volume.

Distance

• The transport activity distance should be  
  based on the SFD, considering the pipeline  
  network, or the GCD.
• A DAF is not required in the case of pipelines,  
  as the limited number of route options 
  available within the pipeline network leads   
  to little opportunity for deviation between the  
  actual distance and the SFD.

Rail

Global impact

The rail freight sector has a relatively low impact on global 
emissions compared to other modes of transportation. In 2018, 
rail freight contributed only 1% of transport GHG emissions, while 
passenger rail accounted for 4%.52 The use of electric rail transport, 
which makes up about 80% of passenger rail and half of freight 
movements, does not release operational CO2 emissions. As for 
the overall final energy mix of rail, diesel consumption plays a more 
prominent role in freight rail, accounting for approximately two-
thirds of its total energy consumption worldwide in 2021.53 

To enhance efficiency and sustainability, the rail freight industry is 
embracing new technologies and operational practices, with several 
countries allocating funding for these initiatives.53 Electrification plays 
a significant role in reducing emissions by eliminating direct emissions 
from rail operations. The use of sustainable fuels such as biofuels is also 
increasing. The expansion of rail networks, including the establishment of 
high-speed rail links, track modernization and digitalization of signaling 
systems, improves efficiency and attractiveness of the system.54

The rail freight sector is expected to experience 
growth in the coming years. The US Federal 
Railroad Administration is committed to 
decreasing the carbon footprint of rail 
transportation by various strategies such as 
promoting the expansion of electrification and 
the use of sustainable fuels. Furthermore, they 
aim to expand the rail network to enhance 
efficiency for both passengers and goods 
shipments, and to implement measures to 
reduce GHG emissions from rail operations, 
maintenance and construction.55 The European 
Union has set ambitious goals of 50% growth 
of rail freight by 2030 and doubling by 2050, 
aiming to reduce GHG emissions and alleviate 
congestion on major road networks.55

However, the rail freight market, particularly 
in the EU, may be directly impacted by a 
substantial increase in energy prices. Rail 
freight operators who haven’t secured sufficient 
energy purchases for 2022 and 2023 could 
face significantly higher costs in the future. This 
cost burden might potentially force operators to 
exit the market, posing a threat to the progress 
made in shifting freight to rail.57

Scope

For rail transport, emissions are associated 
with the energy and/or electricity used 
to power the trains or haul cargo using 
other rail vehicles. This includes energy 
used for train propulsion supplied by hub 
operators’ systems. The GLEC Framework 
v3 also accounts for electricity transmission 

losses (already factored into electricity GHG 
emission factors) and energy resulting from 
brake-energy-regeneration re-injected into 
the grid. Emissions resulting from any internal 
movements within a hub’s boundaries are also 
accounted for; they are classified as logistics 
site emissions and therefore are part of a HOC. 

TOCs 

TOCs for rail transport should be structured 
based on a suitable combination of the 
influencing factors given in the list below.

Operation type:
•  Long-distance freight transport: 
- block train
- single wagon
- intermodal wagon
•  Short-distance freight transport  
  (feeder services)

Freight type:
• Average/mixed
• Containerized/swap bodies
• Dry bulk
•  Liquid bulk
•  Vehicle transport
•  Semi-trailers
•  Other

Condition:
• Ambient
• Temperature controlled

• The extent of electrification varies by region, 
  being particularly common in mainland  
  Europe, but can be difficult to determine if  
  carrier data is not available. 
• Information on regional electrification can  
  be found in RAIL Information System and 
   Analyses (RAILISA) UIC Statistics for the  
  rail sector.60
• EcoTransIT models regional electrification    
  values within its tool.58
• If the train is electrified, choose the  
  appropriate emission factor for the original   
  energy source (if known) and/or electricity    
  grid factor.

Propulsion:
•  Electric motor: 
- fixed electricity supply system  
  (catenary, third rail)
- on-train battery energy storage
- fuel cell energy storage
•  Combustion engine 
• Other

Methodology alignment

In addition to ISO 14083, the GLEC Framework 
v3 is compatible with the EcoTransIT World 
Methodology, recommended by the Union 
Internationale des Chemins de Fer (UIC). In the 
US, the US EPA, SmartWay Rail Carrier Tool 
and the information collected and published at 
federal level by the US Surface Transportation 
Board provide alternative sources of 
information in compatible format. 

EcoTransIT World58 
• The EcoTransIT World tool aligns with the 
   WTW GHG emissions, and the scopes  
  outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Value  
  Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard.
• EcoTransIT allows for reporting emissions as  
  both CO2/CO2e and TTW/WTW. Be sure to   
  always use the values that include WTW  
  and CO2e 
• EcoTransIT divides geographies by region    
  to model the level of electrification vs diesel  
  locomotives, considering the challenge of    
  finding electrification data on a country level.

SmartWay Rail Carrier Tool59  
• Carrier-specific CO2e intensity factors  
  are not available from SmartWay;   
  however, an annual average value  
  representing the emission intensity of North  
  American rail companies is provided and 
  may be useful for benchmarking. 

Requirements for rail 
transport calculations

Shipment mass

• For calculation of the transport activity,  
  actual mass in tonnes is to be used. If this   
  is not available, estimated weight based on 
  the mass of the cargo can be applied. For    
  containerized transport, the weight can be   
  estimated based TEU.
• GHG activity data should be calculated at  
  the consignment level for the freight 
  transport chain using standard freight  
  transport rules.
• Average load factors for default values,  
  where no measured data is available, are not 
  well-established for rail transport. EcoTransIT  
  estimates load factors based on net and  
  gross tonne-kilometers (or revenue and  
  non-revenue tonne-kilometers) for some  
  cargo types, plus standard factors for wagon 
  weights and payload capacity.19 SmartWay   
  provides average railcar capacity data for    
  North America.59 

Distance

• Rail transport activity should be calculated 
   based on the SFD, based on the start and 
  end point of the journey. 
• If you use the actual distance for the  
  calculation of the transport activity, further  
  analysis into any possible deviation is  
  needed to establish the right DAF, given 
  that rail transport is very limited in the  
  routing options and any deviation from the 
  planned route is most probably due to  
  specific reasons.
• Rail distance can be difficult to identify.  
  Some rail carriers and GHG emission  
  calculation tools offer a rail distance  
  calculator to their customers. EcoTransIT’s  
  online tool can also be used to calculate rail  
  distance at no cost. 

Considerations regarding locomotives  
and energy sources

• The most important differentiator for rail  
  transport is whether the locomotive uses  
  electricity or diesel as its energy source. In  
  North America diesel is the most common,  
  and hence assumed, energy source if actual  
  conditions are unknown.
• Information on train length (and hence  
  unladen weight and capacity) can be helpful  
  for improving accuracy. 
• Other potential energy sources are electricity, 
  diesel oils, LNG and biodiesel.

Road

Global impact

In terms of global transport emissions, the road sector is by far 
the biggest emitter, with passenger and freight road transport 
contributing nearly three-quarters of overall transport emissions.61 
In 2021, European road freight transport increased by 6.5 % 
compared to 2020.62 However, the majority of global road freight 
transport growth is expected to come from non-OECD countries.63

The vast majority of road freight transport is powered by diesel and 
a widespread transition to electrified road transport is considered as 
essential to meet global climate targets.64 Electrification of short-distance 
road transport is becoming a common option, whereas electric long-
distance transport is still in its infancy, with gradual commitments being 
made to scale up fleet investment.

Efficiency measures show great promise for reducing emissions from 
road transport. Optimized fleet assignments and routing as well as 
efficient driving behavior are powerful, easy-to implement changes which 
improve energy efficiency.64 Collaboration with supply chain partners 
can increase efficiency further through optimized ordering patterns and 
consolidated loads.

The road freight sector is highly fragmented. 
In the European Union, over 90% of road 
haulage companies have fewer than 10 
employees, and around 85% of road freight 
companies have fewer than five trucks.65 
Similarly, in the United States, the majority 
of carriers (about 91%) operate six or  
fewer trucks.66

Multinational shippers and LSPs may need 
to contract with hundreds, even thousands, 
of road carriers in order to meet their global 
logistics needs. This renders the efficiency 
optimization and thus emission reduction of 
road transportation and its networks difficult, 
although green freight programs can help to 
streamline data exchange processes. 

Scope

Road transport refers to any freight moved 
using a road vehicle over a road network 
between a place of loading and unloading. 
Road vehicles are any vehicles for use on 
roads.67 Road transport emissions under 
the GLEC Framework pertain only to the 
fuel and/or electricity used to operate road 
freight vehicles and their onboard systems 
(e.g., for cooling). The emissions related to 
the production of road vehicles, hubs or road 
infrastructure are not included.67

TOCs 

TOCs for road freight transport should be 
structured based on a suitable combination of 
the influencing factors given in the list below:

Freight type
• Dry bulk
• Liquid bulk
•  Containerized
• Palletized
• Vehicle transport
• Mass-limited, general freight (heavy cargo)
• Volume-limited, general freight (light cargo)

Condition
• Ambient
• Temperature-controlled

Journey type
• Point-to-point long-haul
• Collection and delivery

Contract type
• Shared transport
• Dedicated contract (charter)

Additional factors can be relevant for defining 
a highly specific TOC, e.g., topography, road 
type (highway vs urban vs rural), vehicle mass 
category, wagon/trailer body type.

When computing the emissions of a hub 
and spoke network, different TOCs have to 
be identified for the different elements of 
the network, e.g., one TOC for the transport 
from origin to initial hub, another TOC for the 
transport from final hub to point of delivery 
(i.e., the “spokes”) and another one for the 
line-haul transport from hub to hub.

Methodology alignment

In addition to ISO 14083, the GLEC Framework 
is compatible with the US EPA’s SmartWay 
Truck Carrier Tool. EPA SmartWay collects and 
shares emissions data on thousands of North 
American road carriers, which can be used with 
the GLEC Framework.

SmartWay Truck Carrier Tool9
• SmartWay emission results are expressed    
  as TTW, CO2; therefore, the WTT emissions  
  must be added and the result must be scaled  
  to a CO2e basis for alignment with the GLEC  
  Framework.
• Carrier data is reported as the average  
  CO2/ton-mile for the carrier’s fleet. Carrier    
  emission factors can be used with the proper  
  conversions.
• Conversion from US tons to metric  
  tons may be needed to ensure consistency  
  of reporting.
• Carrier data is reported in SmartWay  
  using actual distance. See the tips below for  
  information on converting actual to planned  
  distance.

Requirements for road 
transport calculations 

Shipment mass and transport activity

• For calculation of the transport activity,  
  actual mass in tonnes is to be used. If this is  
  not available, estimated mass of the cargo   
  can be applied. 
• For containerized transport, the mass can    
  be estimated based on (TEU using standard  
  conversion factors.

Distance

• Road transport activity should be calculated  
  based on the SFD, considering the road 
   network or GCD. Values for the SFD based 
  on the road network can usually be sourced  
  from route planning software or maps.
• If actual distance is used as an alternative    
  to SFD or GCD, e.g., to avoid toll roads or to 
  reach rest points, the transport operator  
  needs to inform the transport user  
  accordingly and ideally also add this  
  information to the reporting.
• When actual distance is used to calculate  
  GHG emission intensity, a DAF must be  
  applied in the final emission calculation  
  to compensate for any deviation. This DAF   
  should be based on the most accurate  
  information available regarding the 
  distance deviation and should be relevant    
  to the context of the transportation. If  
  such information is not available, a general  
  estimated value for the DAF may be 
  used instead.

• When shifting from transportation that uses 
  energy to transportation that does not use  
  any energy, such as using foot or bicycle  
  delivery instead of vans/trucks for mail  
  and parcel delivery, the full distance of the  
  transport activity still needs to be considered  
  when calculating the transport chain’s  
  transport activity.

Time period

• To allow for seasonal impacts, the  
  operational data for regular transport  
  operations should be aggregated over
  one calendar year. In this way seasonal  
  fluctuations and temporary impacts are 
  removed and a long-term trend is identified. 
• Deviations from the general rule of annual  
  aggregation are permitted but must be noted 
  and reported. Shorter aggregation periods  
  may be more relevant for road transport  
  operations due to their short duration and  
  high frequency. An example of where an 
  alternative time period can be appropriate 
  is when a transport service is only provided 
  during a specific time of year.

Energy sources

• Diesel is the assumed energy source type    
  for the majority of road freight transport and  
  the majority of default emission intensities   
  provided in Module 2 are calculated on  
  this basis.
• It is important to reflect the typical national   
  biofuel blend in the emission calculation.
• Other potential energy sources include  
  biodiesel, electricity, hydrogen, compressed  
  natural gas (CNG), LNG and gasoline. 

Consideration of collection and 
delivery rounds

Many road transport operations fall under 
“collection and delivery rounds” which 
involve shared transports with multiple stops 
and changing load factors. For these forms of 
transport, which are particularly common in 
urban deliveries, it is important that you ensure 
that the total energy and GHG emissions for 
each consignment are calculated based on 
its share of the transport activity. You can use 
a notional transport activity to calculate the 
individual consignment’s share of the overall 
transport activity of the entire collection 
and delivery round, based on loading and 
unloading points independent of the actual 
routing, which can vary day to day.

Post and parcel services 

Post and parcel services require a different 
approach. Apart from tracked systems that 
are used for high value individual items, it 
is common for mail items and small parcels 
not to be tracked in such bulk distribution 
systems; where that is the case, a per-item 
emission calculation is a more practical 
approach. Again, it is important that you 
specify which approach was used in the 
reporting and explain any deviations from the 
commonly used method.

Sea

Global impact

Maritime transportation accounts for 80‒90% of global trade68 
and is responsible for about 30% of the global logistics sector’s 
emissions. As the demand for sea transport continues to rise, there 
is a significant increase in GHG emissions, which grew by 10.1% 
between 2012 and 2018, reaching a staggering 1,076 million tonnes.69
Despite facing a temporary setback during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
sea transport has resumed its growth trajectory, experiencing a 
further 4.7% increase between 2020 and 2021,71 with most of the 
increase coming from container ships, dry bulk carriers and general 
cargo vessels.69

The increasing average age of the global fleet is a growing concern, 
as older ships tend to have higher levels of pollution. Currently, the 
average age of the fleet is 21.9 years based on the number of ships and 
11.5 years based on carrying capacity. The reluctance of shipowners 
to invest in new equipment is attributed to uncertainty regarding future 
technological advancements, the most cost-efficient fuels, changing 
regulations and carbon pricing.68 Consequently, there is a pressing need 
for a new generation of ships that can use the most efficient fuels and 
seamlessly integrate with intelligent digital systems. 

Innovative energy sources for sea transport, 
such as electric, hydrogen fuel cell, 
innovative sail systems, ammonia and 
biofuel technologies, are currently under 
development. These emerging technologies 
appear promising for reducing emissions 
and fostering sustainability in maritime 
transportation. Nevertheless, shipbuilding 
volumes remain low, and one of the most 
successful approaches to emission reduction 
at present is the operational practice of slow 
steaming. By reducing a ship’s speed by 10%, 
emissions can be decreased by 27%.71, 72

The global containerized trade is heavily 
dominated by the top 10 container lines, 
which collectively control more than 85% of 
the market.73 Unlike industries with fragmented 
players like the road sector, collective actions 
from a few key players in the maritime industry 
has the potential to drive substantial changes 
and initiatives that can effectively reduce 
emissions and promote sustainability within 
the industry.

Scope

Sea transport is the movement of goods 
on seagoing vessels either wholly or 
partly at sea.74 Seagoing vessels include 
floating marine structures with one or more 
surface displacement hulls. Cargo ships are 
responsible for transporting general goods, 
while tankers are specialized in carrying liquid 
cargo such as oil and gas. Container ships are 
designed to transport standardized containers. 
Bulk carriers handle the transportation of 
commodities like grains, coal and iron-ore.73

All forms of sea transportation that consume 
energy for the primary purpose of transporting 
freight are captured in emission accounting 
under this guidance, in line with ISO 14083. 
These include emissions linked to energy 
consumption for both propulsion of the 
vessel and the maintenance of the freight 
in specific conditions (e.g., cooled or 
temperature controlled).

Whenever the vessel is in port or any other 
location where freight transfer occurs, GHG 
emissions that are related to the vessel’s 
activity should be calculated and reported 
as part of the sea TCE. This means that any 
energy, particularly electrical energy, received 
from the shore that is stored and subsequently 
used for propulsion or to maintain the cargo 
in the required condition, must be incorporated 
as part of the vessel operator’s GHG 
activity data.

Additionally, GHG impact linked to refrigerant 
leakage that is then replenished during a port 
call needs to be included in the calculation of 
the sea transport’s GHG emissions. On the 
other hand, shore power (“cold ironing”) is to 
be included in the calculation of the logistics 
hub, unless otherwise agreed with the 
shipping company.

TOCs

To cluster transport services with similar 
emission intensities, it is recommended to 
structure the TOCs for sea transport based 
on a suitable combination of the influencing 
factors as follows:

Sea freight TOC characteristics:

Vessel types:
• Bulk carrier
• Chemical tanker
• General cargo Ro-Ro
• Liquefied gas tanker
• Oil tanker
• Other liquid tanker
• Container
• Vehicle carrier

Freight conditions:
• Ambient temperature-controlled
• Mixed ambient and temperature-controlled

Service type:
• Scheduled (by origin and destination pairs)
• Tramp (unscheduled)

Mixed sea freight/passenger TOC 
characteristics:

Vessel types:
•  Ro-Pax ferry (mixture of roll-on roll-off 
  freight and passengers)

Vessel size:
• Varies by vessel type (refer to Table G.4 
  of ISO 14083)9

Service type:
• Scheduled (by origin and destination pairs)
• Chartered

representative for the specific transport 
service, based on the schedules in place.

Methodology alignment

In line with ISO 14083 we distinguish two 
ways to categorize vessels or services for 
the purpose of calculating GHG emissions: 
vessel-based categorization and service-based 
categorization.9

Vessel-based categorization

Based on the IMO’s Fourth GHG Study, 
parameters such as freight type, vessel type, 
vessel size categories and freight condition 
(for fully temperature-controlled ships) can be 
combined into generally applicable TOCs for a 
vessel-based categorization. This vessel-based 
categorization method is particularly useful 
for charter services, where the vessel and 
its characteristics are known to both charter 
parties as they are fixed in the contract. As 
primary data is usually accessible in such a 
case, its use for calculating the GHG emissions 
of the sea transport is to be preferred. In all 
other cases, modeled or default data for the 
specific TOC can be used.

Service-based categorization

In cases where the specific vessel is not known 
to the transport service user, the service-based 
categorization can be used. This is often the 
case for container services, Ro-Ro services or 
Ro-Pax services. In such cases, the transport 
operator can usually provide information 
in the form of aggregated values that are 

In addition to  ISO 14083, the GLEC 
Framework aligns with the following 
methodologies, with modifications as 
indicated. 

Energy sources

IMO Energy Efficiency 
Operational Indicator17
• The IMO covers all forms of maritime  
  transport and freight and provides default    
  factors for various ships and energy sources.
• IMO values must be scaled from CO2  
  to CO2e.
• IMO does not specify use of fuel life cycle. 

Clean Cargo Carbon 
Accounting Methodology22
• Clean Cargo covers only container ships  
  though additional guidance may be offered  
  in future.
• Operator-specific data per trade lane is  
  available to Clean Cargo members.
• Specific guidance is available for calculating  
  reefer energy consumption. 

Requirements for sea transport 
calculations

Vessel

There is a unique opportunity for sea 
transport to improve the accuracy of emission 
calculations by finding more specific vessel 
information. Unlike the fragmented road 

sector, where millions of trucks carry goods, 
ships are well-catalogued and tracked, and 
public information on each vessel is available 
via the IMO’s Global Integrated Shipping 
Information System.75

Continuing advances in digitization and data 
sharing within the maritime supply chain 
create more visibility on the actual vessel used 
to carry freight. This holds the potential to 
improve transparency in the supply chain and 
could build towards improved supply chain 
planning for shippers and LSPs, as refined 
vessel values based on carrier and/or vessel 
specific information will be key for tracking 
progress towards emission-reduction goals 
in the maritime sector. If a company invests 
more advanced shipping technology or using 
low sulfur energy sources and slow-steaming 
practices, the company wants its numbers to 
reflect it. 

Shipment mass

For containerized transport, the number of  
TEU slots available onboard is the primary 
limiting factor and the unit used for booking. 
Therefore, TEU is a common unit used instead 
of mass or weight. For example, Clean Cargo 
trade lane emission intensity values are 
expressed as CO2e per TEU. Conversion from 
TEU to tonnes is possible.

If the actual cargo mass per TEU is not known, 
a standard conversion factor of 10 tonnes 
per TEU may be used for a typical container; 
a conversion factor of 6 tonnes per TEU for 
lightweight cargo, and a conversion factor of 
14.5 tonnes per TEU for heavyweight cargo 

50

 
 
 
Refer to the peq values reflecting the  
characteristics of TOCs as follows:9

Passenger transport:
-  Individual passenger (including luggage): 
  peq = 1.0
-  Passenger car: peq = 1.3
-  Bus/coach: peq = 10.0
-  Caravan, small: peq = 1.1
-  Caravan, medium: peq = 2.3
-  Caravan, large: peq = 3.5
-  Mobile home: peq = 3.5
-  Motorcycle: peq = 0.3

Freight transport:
-  Small van: peq = 1.3
-  Large van: peq = 3.5
-  Rigid truck: peq = 10
-  Articulated truck: peq = 18
-  Unaccompanied trailer: peq = 14

can be applied with justification (see also 
Section 1 Chapter 2 Calculation Steps, 
The Calculation in an Overview).

Distance

•  Calculation of transport activity distance for  
  sea transport should be done using SFD or  
  GCD, depending on available information. 
•  Specific sea transport distance calculators 
   are available for accurate results. SFD  
  can be estimated e.g., using online port-to- 
  port calculators or via the Centre d’Études 
  et de Recherches sur le Développement  
  International (CERDI) Sea Distance  
  Database.76
•   Actual distance can be found in ship 
  logbooks. Where this actual distance is 
   used to calculate the emission intensity, a   
  DAF needs to be applied in the subsequent  
  calculation of GHG emisisons.
•  The DAF should be based on the best  
  available information and should be relevant  
  to the transportation context. In the 
  absence  of a specific operational DAF,  
  a default global value can be used. Clean 
   Cargo recommends using a DAF of 1.15  
  since actual sea container transport  
  distances were found to be on average 
   15% greater than the shortest feasible 
  port-to-port route. Convert nautical miles  
  to kilometers using factors in Annex Unit  
  Conversions.

Mode-specific considerations

•  As each TCE must be calculated separately  
  before aggregation to a transport chain,  
  for journeys with multiple legs you must also  
  calculate the GHG emissions for each leg or  
  element individually, before aggregation.
•  For high frequency, regular, repeatable or 
  short duration transport, it is common for 
  the operator to aggregate a year’s worth of  
  operational data for transportation operations  
  that occur during that time period.
•  For charter operations in bulk shipping,  
  quantify and report for specific journeys,  
  as the data is identifiable for the individual   
  journeys.
•  When transporting freight with mixed  
  temperature-controlled consignments, treat  
  it as a single TOC and allocate GHG 
  emissions between the ambient and 
  temperature-controlled consignments based 
  on the share of energy required to move 
  the freight and the energy used to maintain 
  the temperature-controlled freight within the 
  required range.
•  Treat mixed passenger and freight 
  operations, typically for Ro-Pax ferries,  
  as a single TOC and use passenger 
  equivalents (peq) to estimate the allocation  
  of emissions. These peqs are based on a    
  combination of mass- and volume-based 
   equivalents to provide balanced results.

Equally important as the calculation of GHG emissions, 
is their reporting. It is the tool with which an organization 
communicates its efforts and results of GHG emission 
reduction. It is therefore the purpose of GHG emission
reporting to provide transparent and accurate information. 
Reporting also helps stakeholders, including investors, 
customers and regulators, to understand the organization’s 
environmental impact and sustainability performance.

1. An overview of the 
basic principles

The guide “End-to-End GHG Reporting 
of Logistics Operations” published by 
the Smart Freight Centre (SFC) and the 
Global Logistics Emission Council (GLEC) 
jointly with the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and 
the Partnership for Carbon Transparency 
(PACT), considers in detail opportunities, 
requirements and approaches for 
transparent and meaningful emission 
reporting.1 It includes insights and needs 
identified in the years of cooperation 
between the SFC and its partner 
organizations.

Section 2 of the GLEC Framework provides 
companies with recommendations for 
standardized reporting of emissions in line 
with ISO 14083 in a more condensed form.2 
Companies that want to conform with 

the GLEC Framework must report at least 
the minimum elements listed in this chapter. 
However, if companies have more information 
about their GHG emissions that they are 
willing to share, they can refer to other 
reporting frameworks such as the afore 
mentioned End-to-End guide, the GHG 
protocol3 CDP4, and Science-Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi5) guidelines. The reporting 
requirements mapped out in the following 
sections refer to the external reporting of GHG 
emissions. Internal reporting for managerial 
purposes will usually require the inclusion of 
further details and specifications.

Please note that, while carbon offsets may be 
purchased as part of an organization’s overall 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy, 
they are not part of the GHG emission 
calculation and reporting under the GLEC 
Framework v3. Offsetting is a theoretical 
compensation for emissions but not part of 
the emissions caused by an organization and 
therefore not included in ISO 14083.

Reporting: the basics

Emissions should be reported using two key 
performance indicators (KPIs) in conjunction 
with each other:
•  a total GHG emission value, which shows    
  the scale of the overall impact as an  
  absolute value, and
•  a GHG emission intensity value, which links  
  the emissions to the transport activity 
  (for transport operators or service providers), 
  or amount of product (e.g., for manufacturers 
  or retailers), by setting these values in  
  relation to one another.

If Paris Agreement targets for the transport 
sector are to be reached, a step-change 
reduction in both total emissions and emission 
intensity is needed.

Total emissions

Total emissions are important for reporting 
and tracking an organization’s overall 
emissions from year to year. Total, or absolute, 
emissions, are often expressed as kg or 
tonnes CO2e over a defined timeframe.

Emissions can be differentiated into:
•  well-to-tank (WTT) emissions; referred to as  
  energy provision GHG emissions within the  
  GLEC Framework v3 and the ISO 14083,    
  and 
•  tank-to-wheel emissions (TTW), also called  
  tank-to-wake emissions; referred to as  
  operational GHG emissions within the  
  GLEC Framework v3 and the ISO 14083

Jointly, these two add up to the well-to-wheel, 
also called well-to-wake (WTW) emissions and 
they build the emissions of an entire transport 
chain element (TCE). 

The GLEC Framework v3, like the ISO 14083, 
is based on the WTW concept, i.e., the 
inclusion of the entire emissions of a transport 
chain and its elements (see also Section 1 
Chapter 1).

When calculating and reporting GHG 
emissions, there is another approach that 
is often linked to the reporting unit’s scope, 
which includes Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 
3 emissions. This is a fundamental concept 
that the GHG Protocol uses to categorize 
emissions (see also Introduction and Section 1 
Chapter 1.

The GHG emissions accounted for in the 
GLEC Framework v3 and ISO 14083 are also 
included in the scopes of the GHG Protocol. 
However, there are differences in where the 
emissions are represented, depending on 
an organization’s place in the value chain, 
so a direct comparison is not possible. The 
GHG Protocol considers all organization-

Chapter 1
Reporting 
emissions

2

related emissions from different stakeholders, 
distinguishing between an organization’s direct 
owned emissions (Scope 1), indirect owned 
emissions (Scope 2), and indirect, value chain 
emissions (Scope 3).3

From a logistics service provider’s (LSP) 
perspective, emissions from their own 
operated transportation assets and hubs 
are classed as Scope 1, for operational fuel-
related emissions, or Scope 2, for electricity-
related emissions. Related energy provision 
emissions are included in Scope 3, category 3 
(Fuel- and energy-related activities), whereas 
operational and energy provision emissions 
for outsourced transportation are included in 
Scope 3, category 4 (Upstream transportation 
and distribution). From a customer’s 
perspective all of these emissions are included 
in Scope 3, category 4.

57

 
Emission Intensity

Emission intensity is an important KPI to 
gain insight into the efficiency of transport 
and transport operations. Emission intensity 
metrics provide a numerical value to track, 
analyze and strategize emissions reduction. 
They also provide a pathway for companies 
to showcase efficiency in the face of business 
growth; e.g. an expanding business might 
show an increase in total emissions while 
reducing emission intensity.

Generally, reporting a KPI combination of total 
emissions and emission intensity values is 
always the best way to understand how far 
an improvement of transport efficiency and 
sustainability is achieved, e.g., by reporting a 
tonne-kilometer-based emission intensity KPI 
alongside total emissions. 

Emission intensity values provide a numerical 
basis for carriers to communicate to 
customers and stakeholders their progress 
towards meeting emissions reduction targets 
over time. For example, if an operator invests 
in new electric trucks or consolidates its 
shipments to reduce partial loads, the energy 
efficiency will go up and the CO2e intensity will 
go down.

Granularity

Accordance with ISO 14083

In the context of reporting GHG emissions, 
granularity refers to the level of detail at which 
data is reported or analyzed. It is the extent 
to which data is broken down into smaller or 
more specific components.

For example, in the case of reporting GHG 
emissions for transport and hubs, granularity 
may refer to the level of detail at which 
emissions are reported for different modes of 
transport, types of hubs, or specific transport 
or hub services. A high level of granularity 
would mean that emissions are reported 
in very specific detail, while a low level of 
granularity would mean that emissions are 
reported in more general terms.

The level of granularity chosen will depend on 
the goals of the reporting entity and the level 
of detail needed to support decision-making 
or communicate with stakeholders. In general, 
higher granularity can provide more detailed 
insights and support more precise decision-
making, while lower granularity can make 
reporting and analysis more manageable and 
easier to communicate.

2. Basic reporting requirements

The basic requirements of reporting are 
necessary to ensure that the information 
provided is accurate, transparent and of high 
quality, as well as comparable and compatible 
between different actors. They therefore must 
be met when publishing reports or data. 

It is of central relevance that all calculations 
and reporting are carried out in complete 
accordance with the GLEC Framework 
v3. If conformity with ISO 14083 is aimed 
for, reports need to mention explicitly the 
sentence “These calculation results have 
been established in accordance with ISO 
14083:2023”2.

Differences in or omissions or deviations from 
the calculation procedures as specified in ISO 
14083 and the GLEC Framework v3 are to be 
avoided. Where they are unavoidable, they 
must be highlighted and justified, and their 
implications must be described in the report.

Transparency requirements

It is important to make sure that the reported 
GHG emission data is reliable and useful, and 
providing supporting information is essential 
to achieve this. This supporting information 
must be easy to access and understand for 
all users of the report. It should include a clear 
explanation of how the GHG emissions were 
calculated, and any GHG sources or transport 
and hub operations that were left out should 
be mentioned with an explanation of why they 
were omitted.

You also need to describe in detail how 
transport and hub operations were 
implemented, along with any other information 
necessary to understand the method. 

58

Chapter 1
Reporting

Accuracy and data quality

To ensure transparency, an emission report 
should be clearly structured, and the data 
sourcing and calculation must be explained. 
ISO 14083 requires transparent reporting 
of modeled data or default GHG emission 
intensities used in calculations.2 Each report 
should specify the quality of data used by 
indicating the share of primary and secondary 
data applied in the calculation of GHG 
emissions. For secondary data, the report 
should distinguish between the share of 
modeled and default data.2 

If modeled data is used, the report must 
specify the type of model used and the 
parameters applied. If the share of primary 
and secondary data used for different TOC 
parameters (such as vehicle size category, 
filling rate and street category/topography) 
differs as input to a model, the report should 
indicate what the balance of data type is for 
each parameter. Furthermore, for each model 
it should be stated, which of the following 
parameters are included or not:2

•  use of energy or activity-based model
•  vehicle related: vehicle class and fleet  
  profile, energy consumption profile, vehicle  
  configuration (body type and empty vehicle 
  mass, engine type, engine emission class,  
  energy carrier used in vehicle, share of  
  energy carrier)
•  operational: freight type (freight  
  requirements/characteristics, use of specific  
  container types, load factor of average load  
  expressed in tonnes, service type such as 
full truck load, less than truck load etc.,  

  extent of empty trips)

•  journey characteristics: routing including 
  locations of intermediate stops (route  
  characteristics, location characteristics,  
  direct/via locations/multiple collection 
  and delivery), drive cycle (road type, urban/ 
  mixed/long-haul, frequency of stops, speed  
  profile, topography), geographic region of  
  applicability, currents/flowrate, head, cross 
   or tail wind and windspeed, any additional   
  parameters

When using default emission intensities, the 
report must specify the source of the default 
data and justify its use. 

Frequency and format of reporting

Reports should be produced at least 
annually and more frequently when deemed 
necessary and relevant, such as during 
change processes or to evaluate different 
development scenarios. The report must 
specify the exact period covered.

There are different reporting formats that 
an organization can use, depending on its 
objectives and audience. The basic reporting 
format recommended by ISO 14083 covers 
data on the transport chains, the total of GHG 
emissions and GHG emission intensity, as well 
as the total of GHG emissions and emission 
intensity for TCEs of each mode of transport 
and for hub operations, as further presented 
below. Depending on the reporting format, 
additional elements may need to be included 
in the report.2

For more comprehensive reporting, 
organizations may choose to follow the 

SFC and WBCSD’s End-to-End guide1, or 
requirements for reporting as defined by 
the GHG Protocol,3 CDP4 or SBTi5. These 
frameworks require additional reporting 
elements beyond the ISO report (see also Info 
box Additional reporting requirements by other 
standards.)

It is recommended that organizations start 
with a basic report and then progress to more 
comprehensive reporting as they mature in 
their sustainability efforts and stakeholder 
engagement.

In either case, depending on practical issues, 
the report can take the form of either a single 
long report or a short report complemented 
with other information made available 
separately.2 A single long report provides 
a comprehensive and detailed analysis of 
GHG emissions, which can be useful for 
stakeholders who require a more detailed 
understanding of the organization’s or service 
provider’s emissions. The alternative, a short 
report complemented with other information 
made available separately, can provide a 
summary of GHG emissions that is easier to 
understand for stakeholders who require a 
quick overview of the organization’s or service 
provider’s emissions. The form and scope of 
reporting should be determined based on the 
organization’s or service provider’s goals, the 
intended audience and purpose of the report, 
and practical considerations such as data 
availability and resources.

3. Reporting levels

Once the calculations have been completed, 
the results can be used to report and declare 
emissions. ISO 14083 provides two options for 
the level of reporting:2
•  Reporting at the organizational level and 
•  Reporting at the level of transport or  
  hub services

Reporting at the organizational level

The objective of organizational-level reporting 
is to reflect the GHG emissions resulting from 
transport and hub operations that are either 
used or provided by an entire organization or 
clearly defined parts of it. 

This reporting format is suitable for both 
organizations that operate all transport 
services they use, as well as those 
that purchase a significant amount of 
transportation services and wish to report 
on the GHG emissions associated with their 
entire transport chain(s). It can be used for 
an entire organization or parts of it, such as 
business units, profit centers, geographical 
regions of operation, subsidiaries or any other 
relevant criteria.

This level of reporting requires a 
comprehensive and detailed analysis of 
emissions from all modes of transportation 
and operational services used by the 
organization, including the use of fuels, their 
provision and all associated emissions. 

59

 
 
 
The report must include as basic information:2
1. the identification of the transport chains 
covered; 
2. the absolute value of the total GHG 
emissions of the covered transport chains, 
including all related energy provision 
emissions; 
3. the total GHG emission intensity of the 
entire covered transport chains, including all 
related energy provision emissions, specifying 
the type of transport activity distance used;
4. the total GHG emissions for each mode 
of transport, for each hub operation, and all 
related energy provision emissions included in 
the transport chains covered by the report; 
5. the total GHG emission intensity for the 
TCEs of each mode of transport, of each hub 
operation, including all their related energy 
provision, specifying the type of transport 
activity distance used; 
6. a reference specifying where all relevant 
supporting information can be found. 

Reporting at the level of transport 
or hub services

The transport or hub service level report is 
suitable for service providers who want to 
report on the GHG emissions of a specific set 
of transport or hub services that they provide 
to a service user. This level of reporting 
requires a more focused analysis of emissions 
associated with the specific set of services 
provided.

When reporting at the level of transport or hub 
services, the report can either apply to a single 
TCE or to a set of TCEs that comprise part 

of or a full transport chain. The identification 
of transport or hub services covered by the 
report can either be done by listing all services 
included or by specifying the period of time 
during which they were provided and used.

Furthermore, a report at the level of transport 
or hub services should include the following 
details to provide transparency and enable 
improvements of sustainability and efficiency 
of the operations:2

•  Split by hub and transport service:  
  All information provided needs to be split by  
  hub or transport service they are related to.
•  Split total operational and energy provision  
  GHG emissions: The report must split the    
  total GHG emissions into i) operational  
  and ii) energy provision GHG emissions.  
  Additionally, the report should provide a  
  breakdown of GHG emissions by  
  energy carrier.
•  Split of total GHG intensity per mode and    
  hub: When reporting GHG intensity, an  
  average for the entire organization as well  
  as of the intensity of each transport mode   
  and hub must be provided. 

When reporting GHG intensity, indicate the 
granularity of the categories used to group 
similar trips or logistics sites over a set 
period. This will help ensure that all emissions 
incurred are accounted for, even if there were 
empty trips.

The report requirements are similar to those 
for the report at operational level and must 
include as basic information:2
1. the identification of the TCE(s) or transport 
chain(s) covered; 
2. the absolute value of the total GHG 
emissions of the covered TCEs, including all 
related energy provision emissions; 
3. the total GHG emission intensity of the 
TCEs covered by the report, including all 
related energy provision emissions, specifying 
the type of transport activity distance used;
4. a reference, specifying where all relevant 
supporting information can be found;
5. the transport activity covered by the 
report, including a specification of the type of 
distance used;
6. the hub activity covered by the report;
7. GHG emissions related to all vehicle 
operations and hub operations;
8. the operational GHG emission intensity 
of transport operations and hub operations, 
and the transport activity distance used, or 
any other freight transport activity unit used 
(e.g., number of twenty-foot equivalent units 
(TEUs));
9. the total GHG emissions, transport activity 
and/or GHG emission intensities for each 
mode of transport and for each hub operation, 
specifying the type of transport activity 
distance used.

4. Tracking emission reductions 
in conformance with the GLEC 
principles beyond ISO 14083

There are many ways to calculate aggregated 
and mode-specific logistics GHG emission 
reductions on a year-on-year basis. In the 
following, KPIs under the principles of the 
GLEC are listed and explained:
•  Reduction of absolute emissions
•  Reduction of relative emissions
•  Reduction of relative emissions in case  
  no measured data for transport activity 
  is available
•  Reduction of relative emissions per mode 
  of transport

KPI: Reduction of absolute emissions

This is a simple approach to measure a 
reduction in emissions by subtracting the 
previous year’s total transport service-related 
GHG emissions in tonnes of CO2e from the 
current year’s total emissions:

Additional Details strongly 
recommended

• Disaggregation of GHG emissions by 
  mode of transport and by hub location
• disaggregation of total GHG emissions 
  into operational GHG emissions and 
  energy provision GHG emissions
• breakdown of GHG emissions by
  energy carrier.

• Disaggregation of GHG emissions by 
  mode of transport and by hub location
• disaggregation of total GHG emissions 
  into operational GHG emissions and 
  energy provision GHG emissions
• breakdown of GHG emissions by
  energy carrier.

Information value of the KPI: it communicates 
the overall bigger picture, and for reaching 
climate targets we need to reduce our overall 
transport emissions.

Chapter 1
Reporting 
emissions

2

Limitation of information value: This absolute 
result does not reflect relative reductions 
of an organization’s emissions, e.g., if an 
organization has grown in business and at the 
same time has improved its energy efficiency, 
then the absolute emissions could remain 
unchanged, despite this improvement in 
energy efficiency.

In addition to the calculation of the change in 
absolute emissions, it is therefore important to 
consider the change in relative emissions.

KPI: Reduction of relative emissions

For the identification of a structural reduction 
or avoidance of logistics emissions, it is 
important to put emissions into the context 
of actual transport activity (tkm) or hub 
operation activity of the reporting entity. This is 
particularly important for transport operators 
and service providers. If the relative number 
(e.g., emission intensity) in the current year 
is lower than in the previous year then this is 
evidence of structural emission reductions in 
logistics processes or avoided emissions in 
case of total activity growth.

For the calculation of the change in relative 
emissions, the following steps have to be 
carried out:
1. Take the previous year´s emission intensity 
value (in tonnes CO2e/tkm)
2. Take the current year´s total transport 
activity (in tkm)
3. Multiply the previous year’s emission 
intensity value by the current year’s total 
transport activity;

4. Calculate the absolute value of the current 
year’s total emissions in tonnes CO2e.
5. Subtract from the current year’s actual 
emissions the value calculated in Step 3. 
The result is the relative change in emissions 
in tonne CO2e.

Information value of the KPI: By multiplying 
the previous year’s emission intensity value 
with the current year’s total transport activity, 
you obtain the quantity of CO2e that would 
have been emitted in the current year, had 
there been no change in emission intensity 
compared with the previous year. 

If the resulting relative change in emissions 
in CO2e is negative, this indicates that the 
emission intensity of the current year is lower 
than that of the previous year. The value of 
the “relative change in emissions” indicates 
the mass of CO2e corresponding to the GHG 
emissions that have been avoided during 
the current year’s activity compared to the 
previous year.

If the resulting value of the relative change 
in emissions is positive, this indicates an 
increase in the emission intensity. The value of 
“relative changes in emissions” indicates the 
tonnes CO2e produced in addition to those 
that would have been generated had the 
emission intensity remained unchanged.

Limitation of information value: This relative 
value communicates the organization-specific 
improvement or decrease in energy efficiency 
and therefore emission intensity. However, to 
reach overall climate targets we also need to 

reduce total transport emissions. Therefore, it 
is important to calculate absolute as well as 
relative emissions.

KPI: In case no measured data for transport 
activity is accessible

Emission intensities based on activity data 
are most relevant for transport operators and 
logistics service providers. They can also 
be useful for the purchasers of transport 
services to understand the efficiency of their 
purchased transport. However, it is also 
possible, and potentially more relevant for 
shippers who don´t have access to such 
accurate transport activity data, to make a 
similar calculation using an emission intensity 
value based on another metric (e.g., tonnes 
CO2e/t product, tonnes CO2e/products sold) 
to allow for changes in business activity. The 
process is similar to that explained previously 
where the business activity for the current 
year is multiplied by the emission intensity 
of the previous year to calculate a notional 
baseline for the current year. This value is then 
compared with the total emissions for the 
current year.

Use of turnover as the alternative metric is 
discouraged as it is less closely related to 
actual logistics activities, as witnessed by the 
huge variations in market prices for logistics 
services in recent years.

Information value of the KPI: A YOYchange 
in emissions calculated using values such 
as the amount of transported goods instead 
of transport activity can give an idea of the

development of the real emission intensity 
development over the considered period. 
It can be particularly beneficial if supply 
chain restructuring is taking place, as the 
impact of shortening or lengthening supply 
chains is taken out of consideration (as km is 
removed from the metric). It always remains 
an approximation though, and in particular if 
monetary values are included, inflation and 
changes in currency value can distort the 
information.

Limitation of information value: The value-
calculated  still needs to be considered 
alongside the total GHG emissions and can 
be impacted by many other factors, especially 
if a financial approach is taken (e.g., change 
in exchange rates, change in value of goods, 
change in market availability driving transport 
price fluctuations).

KPI: Per mode of transport

A similar approach can be followed to track 
emissions avoided per mode of transport by 
using emission intensity and transport activity 
data specific to each mode. Below is an 
example of road transportation. 
Analysis by mode of transport is a very 
valuable additional KPI to render the 
development of transport efficiency 
transparent. This KPI is computed by using 
emission intensity and transport activity data 
specific to each mode of transport or for 
each hub. The calculation approach remains 
unchanged to the KPI for relative emissions: 
For this example of road transport, the 
emission intensity of the previous year is 
multiplied by the road-specific transport 
activity of the current year. In the next step, 
this product is subtracted from the total road 
transport-related emissions of the current year. 
The difference between the two values is the 
change in tonne CO2e (road).

If the resulting value of the relative change 
in emissions is positive, this indicates an 
increase in the specific transport mode 
emission intensity. The value of “relative 
changes in emissions” indicates the tonnes 
of CO2e produced in addition to those 
generated had the emission intensity remained 
unchanged.

It communicates the overall bigger picture, 
and for reaching climate targets we need 
to reduce our overall transport emissions 
(considering changes in CO2e intensity 
and allowing for a change in business and 
transport activity compared to the 
previous year.)

Limitation of information value: There is no 
specific limitation to the information value 
other than the quality of the available data.

Information value of the KPI: Such an 
analysis allows us to distinguish the 
development of emission intensity of the 
different transport modes. It can be identified 
whether, for example, the emission intensity 
of train transport improved, while the emission 
intensity of road transport worsened. Further 
analysis can then be carried out on what 
the reasons for such changes might be (e.g. 
an increase in traffic jams.) The analysis 
in this case, therefore, would support the 
consideration of shifting transport from one 
mode to another with the perspective of an 
improvement of the overall emission intensity 
of the transport services used or provided.

If the resulting number is negative, this 
indicates that the emission intensity of this 
specific mode or hub during the current year 
is lower than during the previous year. The 
current year’s mode-specific transport activity 
was carried out with a lower emission intensity 
than previously, and the value of the “relative 
change in emissions” indicates the mass of 
CO2e corresponding to the GHG emissions 
that have been avoided.

Additional reporting 
requirements by 
other standards

By using these standards, companies can ensure 
that their reporting is credible, comparable and 
transparent, which can enhance their reputation 
with stakeholders and ultimately contribute to 
the transition towards a more sustainable 
transport sector. 

A range of widely recognized approaches for 
GHG emission reporting exists. These can be 
distinguished into three groups:

These different methodologies and frameworks 
are interconnected and support each other 
in promoting sustainable and low-carbon 
accounting and reporting practices.

• overarching global standards 
  (e.g., ISO 14064, GHG Protocol, European  
  Union Emissions Trading System ( EU ETS))
• transport specific standards (e.g., GLEC,  
  formerly EN 16258, ISO 14083) 
• reporting initiatives (e.g., CDP, SBTi, 
  Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)

In particular, the SBTi5 and CDP4
offer detailed guidance on establishing 
meaningful targets and accounting and 
reporting transport-related emissions in a 
meaningful way, thus supporting organizations 
in improving their reporting accuracy and 
transparency.

All these standards are in alignment with 
the principles and minimum requirements 
outlined in the GLEC Framework v3. 
Therefore, companies that adhere to these 
standards can be confident that they are 
meeting the necessary reporting criteria for 
freight transport-related emissions while also 
going above and beyond to improve their 
sustainability reporting more broadly. 

GHG Protocol3

The development of the GHG Protocol started 
in 1998 as a joint effort between the World 
Resources Institute (WRI) and the WBCSD. Its 
first version was published in 2001, and it has 
since become a globally recognized framework 
for measuring and managing emissions across 
various sectors. The protocol categorizes 
emissions into three scopes, as described 
in Section 1 Chapter 4 “Information and 
Requirements for the Individual Transport Modes 
and Hubs” of this document. 

GHG Protocol guidance is part of SBTi’s criteria 
and recommendations, as well as the base 
methodology for CDP reporting. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard - Revised Edition provides 
guidance for companies reporting their GHG 
emissions.

Required information for Scope 1 and 2 
accounting and reporting includes: 

• Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions that are not  
  related to GHG trades
• Separate emissions data for each scope
• Emissions data for all seven GHGs (CO2, CH4,   
  N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) in metric tons  
  and in tonnes of CO2 equivalent. While GHG  
  Protocol requires the splitting of the emissions,  
  the other approaches only require a value for the  
  combined CO2e.
• For comparisons and target setting, a base year 
  must be chosen and related policy measures    
  have to be stated, along with a description  
  of the related context so that any significant  
  emissions changes in relation to the base year  
  can be recalculated. 
• Emissions data for direct CO2 emissions from   
  biologically sequestered carbon
• Methodologies used to calculate or measure    
  emissions, including any calculation tools used
• Any sources, facilities and/or operations  
  excluded from the inventory

For the calculation of Scope 3 emissions the GHG 
protocol provides The Corporate Value Chain 
(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard 
Supplement. It outlines required and optional 
information that companies should publicly 
report in their GHG emissions report. Required 
information includes:

• Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reported in  
  conformance with the GHG Protocol Corporate  
  Standard
• Total Scope 3 emissions reported separately  
  by Scope 3 category (for full list of Scope 3  
  categories see the relevant CDP section)
• List of Scope 3 categories and activities included  
  and excluded from the inventory with justification  
  for exclusion
• For each Scope 3 category:
• Total emissions of GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O,  
  HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) reported in metric tons   
  of CO2e, excluding biogenic CO2 emissions and  
  independent of any GHG trades
• Any biogenic CO2 emissions reported separately
• A description of the types and sources of data   
  used to calculate emissions, and a description of  
  the data quality of reported emissions data
• A description of the methodologies, allocation   
  methods, and assumptions used to calculate    
  Scope 3 emissions
• The percentage of emissions calculated using   
  data obtained from suppliers or other value 
  chain partners
• For comparisons and target setting, a base year  
  must be chosen and related policy measures    
  have to be stated, along with a description of  
  the related context so that any significant  
  emissions changes in relation to the base year   
  can be recalculated.

SBTi Transport Target Setting Guidance5 
The SBTi, a collaboration between CDP, World 
Resources Institute (WRI), the WWF and the 
United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), was 
formed in 2015 to establish science-based 
environmental target setting as a standard 
corporate practice. SFC and the SBTi have 
joined forces to collaborate and standardize 
greenhouse gas accounting, conventions and 
high-level principles to set global 1.5°C-aligned 
pathways for the transport industry.7 The 
collaboration aims to update the SBTi Transport 
Sector Guidance d. It will develop new 
technical guidance, comprehensively update 
existing resources and define best practices 
for accounting, monitoring and reporting of 
transport emissions.

The transport guidance covers a range of 
end-users, including passenger transport 
companies, logistics service providers, shippers, 
carriers, postal companies, road vehicle 
manufacturers and companies with significant 
transport emissions in their value chain. It offers 
guidance on the transport categories it covers, 
the data required for target modeling, and 
the expected output. It also provides specific 
guidance for different end-users, such as those 
who control a fleet of vehicles or those who 
manufacture road vehicle parts. The guidance 
covers GHG emissions that an organization 
should estimate to model a target, including 
the aggregation of emissions scopes to obtain 
WTW emissions, definitions of activity units, 
approaches for setting science-based targets 
and the interpretation of results obtained with 
the Sustainable Development Agenda (SDA)

Carbon Disclosure Project4

The CDP, started in the UK in 2002, has become 
a multinational NGO to which thousands of 
companies disclose their GHG emissions. CDP 
allows a range of protocols for reporting, and 
most companies report their GHG emissions 
to CDP using the GHG Protocol or a protocol 
based on it. Since 2018 the GLEC Framework 
has been recognized by CDP as a mechanism for 
calculating and reporting logistics GHG emissions 
as part of a broader corporate report.

In 2018, CDP released guidance on creating 
transportation emission intensity metrics.8 
In addition to reporting on emissions, CDP’s 
questionnaire helps companies to evaluate 
the relevance of each category’s emissions, 
assess the potential to collaborate with suppliers 
to reduce emissions and evaluate the risks 
associated with supply chain transport emissions.

CDP guidance includes provisions on how to 
consider transportation in Scopes 1 and 2, and 
detailed reporting requirements for each of the 
15 categories in Scope 3 (listed below).9 Of 
these categories, only five are included in the 
ISO standard, namely: 1. Purchased goods and 
services, 3. Fuel- and energy-related activities, 
4. Upstream transport and distribution, 
9. Downstream transport and distribution, 
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products.

• Category 1: Purchased goods and services.  
  This includes WTW emissions from    
  transportation embedded in goods and services  
  purchased by the reporting organization. These  

  are cradle-to-gate emissions only; transportation  
  from the supplier to the reporting organization is  
  included in Category 4.
• Category 2: Capital goods. Like Category 1, 
  this category contains WTW emissions for  
  transport embedded to capital goods purchased  
  by the reporting organization.
• Category 3: Fuel- and energy-related  
  emissions (not included in Scope 1 or 2. 
  Emissions related to the production and  
  distribution of fuels (WTT) burned in Scope 1 
  are included here.
• Category 4: Upstream transportation  
  and distribution. This category covers WTW    
  emissions from outsourced logistics services    
  used to transport or distribute products from  
  tier 1 suppliers to organization facilities or 
  transport between the organization’s own  
  facilities. These are generally services paid  
  for by the reporting organization.
• Category 5: Waste generated in operation.  
  This category includes WTW emissions related 
  to logistics activities used in the disposal and  
  treatment of waste from an organization’s waste 
  generated in Scope 1 activities.
• Category 6. Business travel. While 
  transportation is central to this category, it is  
  pertaining to the movement of people, not 
  freight. While still important, it is not covered  
  by the GLEC Framework.
• Category 7. Employee commuting. Same  
  as for Category 6.
• Category 8: Upstream leased assets. WTW 
  emissions from facilities or vehicles leased 
  by the reporting organization, i.e., where the  
  reporting organization is the lessee, are included  
  here, if not already reported in Scope 1 or 
  Scope 2. 

• Category 9: Downstream transportation  
  and distribution. This category contains WTW  
  emissions from transportation and distribution   
of goods from the reporting organization  
  and the end customer. In general, these are  
  logistics services not paid for by the reporting   
  organization.
• Category 10: Processing of sold products.    
  WTW emissions resulting from the transport  
  and distribution of sold products, e.g., by a 
  stakeholder in the downstream value chain,  
  are covered here.
• Category 11. Use of sold products. These 
  include the lifetime transport emissions from    
  the use phase of sold products. This may be    
  particularly relevant for transport equipment  
  manufacturers.
• Category 12. End of life treatment for sold 
  products. Particularly important for the 
  circular economy, transportation emissions  
  from the disposal or treatment of a sold 
  product are included here.
• Category 13. Downstream leased assets. 
  WTW emissions from facilities or vehicles  
  leased from the reporting organization,  
  i.e., where the reporting organization is the  
  lessor, are included in this category.
• Category 14. Franchises. WTW emissions 
  related to transportation by franchises should 
  be considered here.
• Category 15. Investments. WTW logistics 
  emissions from investments made by the 
  reporting organization should be tallied here.

Other relevant questions in the Scope 3 
questionnaire include the following:
• Evaluation status. Determine the relevance  
  of each category’s emissions based on criteria 

  noted in the GHG Protocol Corporate Value  
  Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting  
  Standard, such as:
- Size of impact. Use the GLEC Framework  
  default factors to conduct a high-level  
  assessment of supply chain transport required  
  to distribute products, looking for hotspots by   
  mode and region.
- Potential to influence reduction. Examine the    
  potential to collaborate with suppliers around 
  emissions reduction, particularly in the  
  identified hotspots.
- Demand by stakeholders. Supply chain 
  partners, investors and consumers are 
  increasingly asking for transparency 
  on environmental and social impacts on 
  consumers and the general public, such as 
  air quality and climate impacts from freight 
  transport in urban areas.
- Risk. Evaluate potential regulations or brand- 
  related risks from supply chain transport 
  emissions.
• Emissions calculation methodology. Let 
  everyone know you used the GLEC  
  Framework by listing it as the method used to 
  calculate your freight transportation emissions.
• Percentage of emissions calculated using 
  data obtained from suppliers or value chain 
  partners. Use the guidance related to input  
  data from the GLEC Declaration to determine 
  percentages.
• Explanation. Additional useful information 
  could be included in the explanation section,    
  such as:
- GLEC Framework data type
- Sources of default data used
- Notes on terminology, calculations, etc.

Beyond 
reporting 

2

Emission accounting and reporting is a tool and the purpose 
of the GLEC Framework is to support you in making the best 
use of it both for yourself, in optimizing the activities of your 
organization, and for all of us, in reaching climate targets. The 
GLEC Frameworks supports you in this in all the activities above.
You’ve put in the effort to calculate and report emissions, and 
gained insight into emission hotspots from your freight 
activities — so now:

• Set targets
• Use carbon emissions reduction as a KPI
• Develop reduction plan
• Make your efforts visible
• Motivate staff
• Leverage sales and procurement
• Advocate for policy

Different aspects of this list might have a different relevance for your specific situation. 
It is important to start with a first step, regardless of how big or small it is.

Set targets 

A recommended first step is to use your 
collected data to establish a baseline and 
set targets in line with the Paris Agreement 
targets of staying within 1.5°C of global 
warming. Develop goals based on both total 
emissions and emission intensity, ideally on 
a transport mode level. These goals help you 
to identify target values for your emission 
reduction efforts. Once these goals have 
been established, you can use the GLEC 
Framework to evaluate different alternative 
measures you could take and estimate which 
of those measures holds the potential to help 
achieve your goals. Once you have decided 
on the strategy you want to take, the GLEC 
Framework is also the ideal tool to establish 
intermediate goals and measure whether you 
are approaching those targets. Once you 
have reached your goals, set higher targets. 
It is important that the targets you set are 
the starting point for a continuous emission 
reduction process.

Chapter 2
Beyond 
reporting 

2

By establishing concrete targets not only for 
2050, but also for the next 5, 10 or 15 years, it 
becomes easier to check if your organization is 
on track.

Use Carbon emission reduction as a KPI

Emission reduction targets need to be 
integrated into the management information 
system of your organization and they need to 
be supported at all levels of your organization, 
led by the directors. Sustainability, and with 
that the reduction of carbon emissions, should 
be a key element of your vision and strategy 
and needs to be supported by strong corporate 
policies favoring low carbon freight and logistics. 
Precise and regular emission accounting is an 
important tool to measure and optimize against 
your efficiency KPIs and minimize your GHG 
emissions. It enables you to:
•  Track progress of emissions over time and   
  against targets, and steer the management  
  of emissions
•  Evaluate different transport and logistics  
  solutions and compare them
•  Identify hot spots in your freight activities    
  where efficiency improvements are most  
  needed or where easily attainable areas for  
  emissions reduction projects exist
•  Hold logistics and operations directors  
  accountable, by using carbon emissions as
  a KPI alongside cost, quality, timeliness,  
  etc., in order to understand the climate  
  implications of new technologies, shipping  
  routes, carriers and other metrics, or to  
  decide upon emissions reduction strategies,  
  carbon offsets and other mitigation  
  measures

•  Compare yourself to others and determine   
  where you can do better, share your  
  experiences with others, or turn your  
  efficiencies into something marketable
•  Prepare for a low-carbon world by applying  
  a fictive price or price range to emissions    
  and use the carbon price as a parallel KPI in  
  decision-making.

Develop a reduction plan

Five solution areas for reducing GHG emission 
have been identified by Professor Alan 
McKinnon: covering freight demand, freight 

transport modes, asset utilization, fleet energy 
efficiency and carbon content of energy.29 The 
GLEC Framework supports you in identifying 
which measure of these areas helps you 
achieve your emission target. It helps you to 
identify the most pressing areas for action, 
as well as to prioritize measures and changes 
to your supply chain, transport and logistics 
network. Furthermore, it helps to determine if 
selected solutions are collectively sufficient to 
achieve corporate reduction targets.
What solutions companies can implement or 
influence depends on whether you are a buyer 
or supplier of freight services, or both.

Make your efforts visible

The use of standardized GHG emission 
accounting is a valuable, respected and 
increasingly requested action for companies 
to render their sustainability efforts visible 
and to prove their commitment to meeting 
climate targets. In areas such as financing 
and insurance, as well as in tender processes, 
this commitment is taken into consideration 
for evaluation of organizations. Adopting 
the GLEC Framework v3, and therefore the 
ISO 14083, ensures that organizations are 
prepared for such demands and expectations 
from their stakeholders. It also equips them 
with a KPI corporates can share with their 
customers, who are increasingly looking for 
sustainably produced products and services.

Figure 3 
Sales and Procurement – powerful 
levers for emission reduction

Aim higher

Sales

LSPs

Procurement

Carriers

•  Procurement. Just as you can provide  
  GHG emission accounting information for    
  your customers, you can also use the GLEC  
  Framework in your procurement, to ensure  
  that the services you purchase are 
  aligned with your corporate values. The  
  Smart Freight Procurement Guidelines  
  document provides  practical guidance on 
   how to integrate  climate into freight 
  transport and logistics procurement  
  practices.10 The Guidelines suggest several  
  actions to reduce GHG emissions that can 
  be undertaken in the various procurement  
  phases, i.e., planning, tendering, contracting 
  and contract-based supplier management,  
  with subcontracted transport chain  
  operators such as freight forwarders,  
  carriers and LSPs. 

Motivate your staff

Advocate for policy

The impact of learning about processes and 
procedures within your own organization in the 
course of the data collection for your emission 
accounting should not be underestimated. 
Many companies who introduced GHG 
emission accounting have reported that this 
analysis of transport and logistics processes 
in connection with the data collection has 
already resulted in insights about inefficiency 
and improvement potentials.

Leverage sales and procurement

Two important business mechanisms to 
leverage carbon reduction, and where reliable 
emissions data are essential, are sales and 
procurement. 

•  Sales. If your organization is making 
  sustainable investments such as electric 
  vehicles, driver training and fuel-efficient 
  routing, this information can be used to drive 
  brand value as a provider or user of  
  sustainable transport. Emission intensity 
  KPIs, such as CO2e per tonne-kilometer, 
  provide information that allows your 
  investments to be showcased and 
  celebrated. This information, in turn, can be  
  used as a KPI in logistics planning activities,  
  such as  choice of transport modes, routes  
  or vehicle. 

A main driver for companies to take charge of 
logistics emissions is to avoid governments 
imposing mandatory requirements. 
Companies can use results from emissions 
calculations to demonstrate that reduction 
efforts are successful. This is best done 
through voluntary reporting schemes or green 
freight programs. United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (US EPA) SmartWay, 
ObjectifCO2 in France, and the Low Emissions 
Reduction Scheme in the United Kingdom are 
some examples.

With the ISO 14083 a norm that can be 
applied on a global scale is now available. 
This internationally applicable norm renders 
it possible for organizations to apply one 
GHG emission and reporting approach to all 

Chapter 2
Beyond 
reporting 

2

modes, all over the world. Using the GLEC 
Framework v3, which is fully aligned with 
this norm and with reporting programs such 
as CDP and SBTi, is therefore also a way 
of advocating for a universally aligned GHG 
emission calculation format.

A further use of emission data is to inform 
the development of national climate plans. 
Countries implementing the Paris Accords are 
responsible for developing and implementing 
an emissions reduction plan to collectively 
reach 2050 global temperature goals: < 1.5°C 
warming from pre-industrial times. Whilst 
transport as a whole is acknowledged in 
most Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), freight transport is often not explicitly 
referenced, nor are transport-specific 
targets set.11,12 

Although the above picture is slowly 
changing, there is still a great potential 
to leverage industry’s expertise and data 
on logistics emissions to enable more 
countries, regions and municipalities to 
better understand and reduce their logistics 
emissions. Through the sharing of data and 
aligning best practices with the principles of 
the GLEC Framework and GLEC Declaration, 
governments and industry can work together 
to track and meet 2050 climate goals.

ISO 14083 is a further step realized on the path towards 
global uptake of standardized transport chain GHG emission 
accounting and reporting. With its publication, the basis for 
a globally harmonized emission reduction effort is here. The 
GLEC Framework v3 renders this basis accessible for everyone. 
Furthermore, the GLEC, as platform for industry and experts, 
facilitates the necessary cooperation for further implementation.
Next important steps are:

• Data quality assurance
• Data exchange
• Further alignment of emission tools and approaches
• Sustainability initiatives
• Assurance
• Policy

Data quality assurance

With a standard for emission accounting and

guidance and assurance processes for data 
quality as a next step. Such data quality 
assurance protects companies’ efforts from 
greenwashing by validating their efforts. Along 
with data exchange, these two steps are key 
for a global uptake, and one supports the 
other. Reliable and assured data quality is 
needed for data exchange. At the same time 
data exchange and big data is required for 
establishing meaningful default data basis.

Data exchange

Improved access to reliable data will help 
both business and governments make 
better decisions to collectively reach climate 
goals. To get there, improved data exchange 
and supportive programs, tools, initiatives, 
standards, policy and research are key.
Access to good quality, preferably 
independently verified, data is a condition 
for transport operators and their customers 
to maximize the impact of applying the 
GLEC Framework. Data collection and 
sharing initiatives exist, such as Clean Cargo 
and SmartWay. For transport operators, 
particularly in the road freight sector, their 
customers, information technology system 
providers and operators of energy efficiency 
and emissions data platforms further efforts 
are needed to: 
•  Harmonize the approach to the collection    
  of the data necessary for comprehensive    
  and meaningful freight emissions KPIs.
•  Develop consistent formats to enable data   

  sharing between an interoperable network  
  of platforms.
•  Incorporate consistent reporting of carbon   
  emissions, and hence the development  
  and implementation of a widespread GHG   
  emission reduction strategy.

We are already in a world of big data, and 
with digital technologies that coordinate the 
complex movement of millions of tonnes of 
goods each day, the amount of data is only 
going to increase. Digitization creates the 
breeding ground for new opportunities to 
design data-driven decarbonization strategies. 
To achieve that, data collection and exchange 
is needed.  Smart Freight Centre is currently 
running the iLEAP project (Integrating 
Logistics Emissions and Product Carbon 
Footprints) which aspires to standardize the 
attributes for emissions and activity-related 
data exchange in logistics. Once this work 
matures and is widely adopted as a semantics 
blueprint, the use of the GLEC Framework 
would also naturally scale more globally 
across many geographies and industries. In 
addition, in an effort to research how can B2B 
data exchanges scale, the report of the SFC 
Exchange Network project21 summarizes the 
conditions needed for technology, governance 
and assurance in establishing such an 
interoperable, decentralized industry-wide 
data exchange network. 

towards global uptake. The more programs 
are aligned, the more easily companies can 
improve their accounting and reporting, 
as they do not have to adjust to different 
requirements. Full alignment ensures 
transparency on emission accounting and 
reporting requirements. As one of these 
steps, the GLEC Framework has supported 
the development of the ISO 14083 and is 
now presenting itself in the third version fully 
aligned with this norm. 

Further alignment of emission tools and 
approaches

Next to the alignment of data quality and its 
assurance, the further alignment of emission 
tools and approaches is an important step 

The GLEC Framework is, and has always 
been, a methodology, and not a calculation 
tool or program. Green freight programs 
promote sustainability within the logistics 
sector, often by engaging both the transport 
supplier and buyer.13 These programs provide

a pathway for industry to collaborate, share 
data and benchmark performance. Incentives 
such as awards, ratings and labels draw 
attention to good performance, encouraging 
reluctant companies to further invest in 
sustainability. Programs that include emission 
reporting either have their own tools, such as 
SmartWay, or prescribe a methodology for 
member companies to use, such as Green 
Freight Asia.

Companies and others who make use of 
external tools or programs should check with 
their providers whether their methodology is 
in conformance with the GLEC Framework v3 
and ISO 14083. Those that are in conformance 
can be recognized though a Smart Freight 
Centre certification label.

Sustainability initiatives

Assurance

A further effective way to realize widespread 
uptake of the GLEC Framework is through 
climate and sustainability initiatives that reach 
beyond the freight sector.

Many companies have started to disclose 
sustainability information such as GHG 
emissions in yearly reports or Business-to-
Business declarations.

The CDP already recommends using the 
GLEC Framework for companies that report 
logistics emissions to the scheme.14 It is 
also the basis of the SBTi’s guidance for 
the transport sector, allowing companies to 
include logistics in their corporate targets.15 
The GLEC Framework is one of the actions of 
the Global Green Freight Action Plan, which 
is a transport initiative under the Marrakech 
Partnership for Global Climate Action of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.16 All initiatives with a climate 
or sustainability focus, including socially 
responsible investment funds, are encouraged 
to follow suit.

The freight sector is not in control of its 
own destiny but merely responds to market 
demand. For that reason, mainstreaming the 
inclusion of logistics GHG emissions through 
the GLEC Framework and ISO 14083, into 
sectoral sustainability initiatives, is key. The 
electronics sector is leading the charge 
through inclusion of the GLEC Framework 
in the Electronic Product Environmental 
Assessment Tool (EPEAT) standards of the 
Green Electronics Council.17 Similarly, it has 
been incorporated in guidance for container 
port terminals.18  Ideally, product labels, such 
as for cotton, food and forestry products, will 
all assess whether logistics emissions is a 
blind spot.

Assurance, in the form of verification 
of corporate emission calculations and 
claims and the certification of calculation 
tool methodologies, is important for these 
companies for two reasons: transparency 
towards others, and clarity and reliability 
towards their own management.

As far as transparency is concerned, 
independent assurance confirms to external 
partners and stakeholders that accounting and 
reporting are carried out reliably according 
to a specified norm. The assurance is 
confirmation to external partners of the efforts 
made by an organization. At the same time, 
such assurance supports customers to trust 
the reported emissions, and is the basis used 
by governments to establish policy measures. 

Assurance also confirms that the GHG 
Emissions Report has been prepared based 
on an approved approach. As emission 
accounting is used as the basis for important 
strategy decisions by management, it is 
crucial to know that the methodology is 
correct, and the results have been verified.

SFC and the GLEC are supporting industry 
along the assurance path, by:
•  Helping organizations to find a competent   
  Verification Body, 

•  Providing a practical emissions reporting 
   template that covers all of ISO 14083 
   (including guidance in the GLEC    
  Framework),
•  Offering high-quality training on Emissions   
  Accounting and Reporting tailored to the    
  Freight sector.

Methodology development
•  Back the GLEC Framework and now 
  ISO 14083
•  Back a single global set of fuel emission  
  factors, including alternative fuels
•  Support awareness and information  
  campaigns for industry

Policy

Supportive policy is essential to help business. 
It is already 10 years since a coherent set of 
policy recommendations was developed in 
consultation with government, industry and 
civil society representatives to ensure wide 
acceptability.19 These recommendations are 
timely and relevant. They are grouped around 
four “enablers” of accounting and reporting:
•  Methodology development for logistics  
  emissions accounting
•  Data collection and exchange
•  Assurance of logistics emissions data and   
  related information
•  Use of results by business, government and  
  other stakeholders

Assurance
•  Give companies incentives to collect high    
  quality data and obtain assurance
•  Explore assurance needs in case of  
  mandatory reporting or carbon pricing
•  Support standardized assurance guidance   
  and reporting template

Data collection and exchange
•  Back International Maritime Organisation    
  (IMO)/ Internation Air Transport Association 
  (IATA) protocols and alignment
•  Support development of global (or EU) data  
  exchange protocol(s)
•  Explore development of neutral platform and  
  IT architecture with a Transport Management  
  System (TMS) link
•  Take a more central role in data exchange 

The objective is, through recommending 
policy priorities, to enable policy making 
that is aligned with both high-level targets 
and industry needs and activities. It can be 
used by national governments in countries 
worldwide, the European Commission, and 
related organizations involved in setting 
or implementing policy agenda such as 
development banks and non-governmental 
organizations.

Use of results
•  Establish national green freight programs
•  Make government targets relevant to  
  the sector
•  Support industry surveys and recognition
•  Include in NDCs/national plans:  
  infrastructure, vehicles/vessels and 
  their operation

71

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The aim is to help make informed choices 
when deciding what new research to carry 
out or fund. It can be used by national 
and international governments, as well 
as research institutes, industry and civil 
society. It is emphasized that efforts should 
involve industry, accompanied by pilots for 
testing and validation in cooperation with 
research institutes. 

In conclusion

Society and your business need you 
to track and reduce carbon emissions 
from freight transport. We believe the 
GLEC Framework plays a crucial role in 
this by providing a common language to 
track climate impacts. Adopt the GLEC 
Framework and ISO 14083 today! 

Research

A lot has been achieved through the close 
cooperation between industry and research 
over the past years. Currently, climate change 
and its impacts are becoming more and 
more visible. We are all on a learning curve, 
learning from cooperation and developments 
that have already taken place, and the impact 
of our actions and non-actions. The journey 
to sustainability is therefore continuing and 
requires further adjustment and developments. 
Supportive research is important to inform and 
advance action by industry. Yet it is unclear 
what research is most needed on emission 
accounting and reporting. A research agenda 
was developed that recommends five areas of 
further research to:19
•  Improve input data, emission calculation 
  and disclosure across different modes,  
  countries and industry sectors
•  Standardize the way data is exchanged  
  between parties, using protocols and  
  platforms and updating transport 
  management systems, and address trust 
  issues between parties
•  Extend emission calculations to include  
  ICT, infrastructure, packaging and air  
  pollutants
•  Allow for emissions calculation as part  
  of project and infrastructure planning and    
  organization of the logistics supply chain

Emission factors play a crucial role in the calculation of 
transport emissions and the calculation of carbon footprint. 
They provide a consistent metric to convert the fuel and 
energy used to power freight transportation into greenhouse 
gas emission values.

You might think that one sort of fuel 
always causes identical emissions. This 
is not the case though. If tracked in any 
detail, the emission factor associated with 
fuel purchased on any particular day at a 
particular location would have a
natural variability associated with it. This is 
because emission factors vary, depending 
e.g., on the nature of the original 
feedstock, the locations of production and 
consumption, the distribution mechanisms 
used, the energy inputs to and the nature 
of the production processes used. In 
general, conventional (i.e., fossil) fuels tend 
to be blends that originate from a mix of 
sources and processes developed over 
many years to ensure that they fit within 
the tolerances of the prevailing local fuel 
quality standards. As a result, it is not 
standard practice to try to put an exact 
figure on every batch of fuel. Instead, it is 
accepted practice to use representative 
values with the understanding that 
emissions will, over time, average out and 
match the representative value (assuming 
that it is truly representative). Variations in 
national fuel standards and local industrial 

energy efficiency can be identified in the 
figures quoted in some national emission 
factor databases.

Generally, variations tend to be relatively low 
and the potential feedstocks and production 
processes for conventional fuels are relatively 
well known. In contrast “new fuels,” including 
some renewable fuels and fuels quoted as 
having low life cycle GHG emissions, tend
to have a less well-established production 
process. They have a greater variability 
over the full life cycle as well as a wider 
range of possible feedstocks. Therefore, 
generalization of emission factors for biofuels 
is less appropriate and could lead to greater 
uncertainties and inaccuracies, at least under 
current market conditions. Full consideration 
of emission factors for “new
fuels” can be necessary, even if this involves 
a time-consuming and costly process. This is 
applicable to pure biofuels as well as higher- 
blend products. It is not necessary for blends 
with relatively low percentages (5‒10%) of 
biofuels with conventional fuels, which are 
commonplace.

How we source the emission factors

It is vital that emission factors are based on 
the most credible sources and are developed 
by specialists. Full development of emission 
factors is outside the technical scope of the 
Global Logistics Emission Council (GLEC).

Instead, we make use of the best available 
sources in line with the approach developed 
for, and described in, Annex J of ISO 14083. 
The ISO 14083 approach recommends 
that the emissions associated with fuel and 
energy production infrastructure are included, 
although this is an approach which is not yet 
commonplace across emission factor sources.

The emission factors quoted in this GLEC 
Framework module are presented in the same 
layout as ISO 14083, i.e., the tables present 
CO2e emissions for the well-to-tank (WTT), 
tank-to-wheel (TTW) and full well-to-wheel 
(WTW) phases of the fuel cycle. Values are 
shown by mass and energy content. Density is 
provided where appropriate so that emissions 
per volume can also be calculated, given 
that conventional liquid fuels are generally 
sold by volume. We include a value for non- 
CO2 operational GHG emissions. Non-CO2 
operational greenhouse gases include methane 
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur 
hexafluoride (SF6) and other fluorinated gases. 
We also include the biogenic CO2 operational 
values for the bio-based fuels as required for 
a complete Scope 3 reporting under the GHG 
Protocol.

The input data is from the latest updates  of 
the same sources.  The sources that have seen 
significant revisions, namely the release of the, 

EcoTransIT methodology 2024, ecoinvent version 
3.9.1 and the GREET 2023 annual update.

Additionally, the latest Global Warming Potential 
(GWP), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) AR6,1 has been used to convert 
all the fuel emission factors to current CO2e. 
These are based on new values of GHGs, for the 
values in Annex K of ISO 14083, which is based 
on IPCC AR5.2

The use of ecoinvent 3.9.1 is particularly 
significant because its content was updated 
following identification of previously unknown/ 
unquantified high levels of methane venting 
direct to atmosphere in the fossil fuel extraction 
phase. The result is that the energy production 
(WTT) emissions are significantly higher, in some 
cases up to 50%, for fossil and fossil- derived 
fuels than previous energy production emission 
estimates.

We have taken all possible steps to provide a 
detailed starting point for companies wishing 
to calculate emissions in a harmonized and 
representative way. However, the higher energy 
provision (WTT) values that result from the 
ecoinvent update do highlight how easy it is 
for emission factors from different sources to 
become significantly misaligned with each other 
until consensus is re-established.

Because the emission factors of renewable fuels 
tend to have a much wider variability, the values 
quoted here tend to be conservative (i.e., at the 
higher end of the possible range). We encourage 
you to use the specific emission factor, backed 
up by the associated documentation, whenever 
you are able to identify the energy carrier
you have used and when you have access to a 
certified emission factor for this product,

provided by a reputable organization (e.g., RSB, 
International Sustainability & Carbon Certification 
(ISCC) that follows the emission factor guidance 
set out in Annex J of ISO 14083.

the aim of maximizing overlap with nationally 
published values, existing transportation standards 
and values used by the representative UN bodies 
for air and water transportation.

Methane slip

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Therefore, 
the potential for leakage of methane, in the 
upstream chain, the refueling and at the engine, 
must be taken into account when calculating 
the WTW emissions of compressed natural gas 
(CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuels. 
Venting of methane from refueling the tank or 
at various points further up the supply chain is 
considered in the WTT component of the overall 
emission factor.

The TTW emissions must be considered in 
a slightly more complex way than for other 
fuels. The impact of any unburned fuel that is 
released to the atmosphere, known as “methane 
slip,” is calculated using the GWP of methane 
alongside the emissions that result from the 
combustion of the majority of the fuel. The 
extent of the methane slip varies according 
to the vehicle technology and any emission 
abatement technology that is fitted. Furthermore, 
the legislation that applies to engines used in 
different situations varies, with different limits 
on methane emissions applying by application, 
location and mode. The result is that it can be 
difficult to put a definitive value on emissions 
from the use of LNG or CNG. We have included 
a first estimate of methane slip and consequent 
impact on the TTW emissions, differentiating by 
engine technology where information is available.

National, regional and international values

The emission factors have been chosen with 

However, several countries including France, UK, 
Japan, Australia and Canada have published 
national emission factors. Emission factor 
guidance is also provided for air transport via 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation ( CORSIA), whilst the IMO 
published its own WTW emission factors . Much of 
this work has been conducted in partial isolation 
and may lead to confusion and uncertainty in the 
short term as to which values to use in the near 
future.

As increasing emphasis is placed on GHG 
emissions, it is likely that further, coordinated 
effort will be placed on developing a coherent and 
comprehensive set of GHG emission factors that 
can be used to enable consistent reporting from 
the global logistics sector such as the CLEVER 
project which is co-funded by European Union. 
Until that point, where specific emission factors 
are mandated in national or international legislation 
then they should be used and the values stated 
clearly in the explanatory notes, as it is not the role 
of the GLEC Framework to advise companies to 
act against the locally prevailing law.

For countries where there is no clearly stated 
emission factor, we recommend that you use the 
higher of the values quoted for the fuel in question 
in the China, European and North American tables, 
in order to avoid accidental understatement of the 
results.It is likely that all the emission factors will 
need to be further updated in subsequent versions 
of the Framework as knowledge of the subject 
develops further.

^ Factors based on long distance/heavy duty road transport only, as LNG is not recommended for light duty/urban distribution.

• GHG emission factors for biofuels can vary considerably according to feedstock mix and process. Certified waste stream  
  feedstocks can lead to low or even negative emission factors under certain circumstances; emission factors need to be carefully  
  checked in such circumstances to avoid unintended consequences and overstatement of emission reduction benefits.
• Bio-LNG and bio-CNG based on GHG reduction threshold to qualify under the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II.)8
• Emission factors sourced from ecoinvent v3.9.1 and the European electricity emission factor above are the only ones confirmed  
  to include fuel and energy production infrastructure in the WTT element as this is a new requirement.
• Electricity emission factor above is from a different source to that used to calculate EU rail default emission intensities as we are  
  unable to quote the IEA values here.

•  China fuel emission factors are mainly calculated based on the official data and aligned with latest IPCC AR6 GWP100.  
  Electricity values are based on  grid emission factors from China.
•  European fuel emission factor (TTW to WTW ratio) from the GLEC Framework 3.0 have been used to uplift the TTW to

GHG Emissions from Electricity

The understanding of what is included in an 
electricity GHG emissions factor, primarily 
based on ISO 14083 requirements can 
be seen in Figure 1. This entails different 
electricity stages upstream (fuel production) 
and combustion (power generation) emissions. 
As the figure points out, part of the electricity 
is used for own-use, load-balancing (e.g. 
by pumping), and trade. Transmission and 
distribution losses are the difference between 
supplied and consumed electricity. The larger 
arrows in the figure represent larger amounts 
of electricity available, and their darker color 
represents a “dirtier” mix, so a higher carbon 
intensity of electricity

For Europe, Figure 2 represents the GHG 
emissions factors from different types of energy 
sources. The fossil-fuel-powered electricity 
mix will have a higher emission factor than 
renewable and nuclear-powered. The figure 
provides more information on upstream 
emissions (up to 100 gCO2e/kWh) ) for fossil 
fuels (or 10 to 20% of the total) should be 
included in the calculation. On the other hand, 
the emissions from renewable power generation 
infrastructure range from 10 to 40 gCO2e/kWh. 
The emissions from this will only become a 
significant portion of the total when the share 
of renewable energy is high. For example, if the 

energy consumption is based on half natural 
gas and half solar PV, the emissions from sole 
infrastructure would constitute 9% of total. 
(SFC. Measuring and Reporting the Carbon 
Footprint of Electric Freight Vehicle Operations: 
Whitepaper. 2024.)35

Considering the trade of electricity, which 
drastically changes the consumption emission 
factor, depending on the average power 
generation emission factor of the exporting 
and importing country. Taking an example, 
the electricity emission factor of Estonia in 
2019 dropped by one third due to the import 
of predominantly low carbon electricity. 
The amount and type of energy traded can 
drastically change from year to year, such as 
when there is a shortage in natural gas. 

Average transmission and distribution (T&D) 
losses varies depending on type of voltage 
distribution (i.e., low to high voltage grid 
connections). The final consumption at high 
and medium voltage sites are about 1 to 10% 
lower than at low voltage sites, reflecting about 
1 to 78 g CO2e per kWh of consumption as 
compared to the EU average which is 3 to 4% 
and 15 to 19 g CO2e per kWh of consumption. 
Most databases typically provide a national 
average for the T&D losses, which is suitable 
for emissions disclosure.

at 397 g COeq/kWh, emissions intensity is equivalent to disel truck 26 to 40 t

The final consumption emission factor provides 
the most appropriate basis to then compare the 
emissions intensity of an EV and diesel truck. 
Figure 3 provides a country-level comparison 
for emissions from electricity consumption 
in European countries in 2019 (Scarlat et 
al., 2022), as well as a comparison with the 
emission intensity of a diesel truck (Smart 
Freight Centre, 2019).38 The values include fuel 
production, power generation, infrastructure, 
trade, and transmission & distribution losses. 
The analysis shows that approximately half 
provide an electricity emission factor less than 
that of a diesel truck, and only 8 countries 
reduce emissions by at least 50%. An EV 
operating within the EU-27 would have an 
emission intensity reduction of 16%. In the US, 
based on eGRID subregion 2021, which does 
not include the effects of fuel production and 
infrastructure, only 3 out of 27 regions provide 
an emissions reduction of more than 25%.

Table 1 compares several prominent databases. 
ISO 14083 recommends using the best 
available national GHG emission factors. 
Considering reporting of the global footprint of 
Electricity, the IEA emission factor database, 
which is updated annually would have seemed 
to be sufficient. However, based on Table 1, the 
database does not include the full spectrum 
of emission categories for electricity such as 
emissions from fuel production.

Other national databases or emission factors, 
such as supplied by the Dutch, UK and US 
government include power generation, trade 
effects, and transmission and distribution 
losses.The Dutch database, however, provides 
the fuel production emission factors, and as 
reference the emissions from infrastructure, 
based on the analysis CE Delft (2022).40 

EcoTransIT World (2024) and Ecoinvent v3.9.1 
provides emission factors at the country-level, 
with electricity mix based on generation and 
consumption.

The GHG emission factors presented is based on the latest  IMO GHG data as published in the 
output from MEPC81. Where MEPC81 has not provided a  necessary data point as input to the 
calculation this data has been sought from the final Fuel.EU  regulation. If there is still an input 
data gap then the required data has been sourced from an  alternative, well-established, peer-
reviewed source for GHG emission factors that follows the approach set out in ISO 14083 and 
used in the GLEC Framework. 

•  The calculation here uses the latest IPCC global warming potential (GWP) 100 Interim  
  Assessment Report (AR 6) 2023 as compared to IMO and Fuel. EU calculations, which we  
  believe IMO will update to latest values at some point.
•  Viscosity is the primary variable that defines a fuel within the IMO fuel oil classifications. Within  
  each viscosity class there are subdivisions based on sulfur content which is why the terms  
  ULSFO and VLSFO recur repeatedly in the fuel names. It would be helpful if the IMO tidied up t 
  this naming convention

•  LFO and LPG are lower due to a lower WTT contribution to the total; potentially due to the new 
source (Fuel.EU) lagging on acknowledging the latest knowledge on methane emissions in the 
production phase.
•  LNG and Bio-LNG in dual fuel medium speed engines are higher as the latest IMO value is 
higher than in earlier drafts or in Fuel.EU
•  Biodiesel (FAME) and HVO are lower as IMO now includes WTT values that were not previously 
present and which are lower than the RED II values included previously.
•  The IMO or Fuel.EU do not have complete emission factor estimates for production of hydrogen 
or ammonia from non-fossil fuel sources and limited emission factor estimates for methanol or 
ethanol.

Revised Calculations

In air transport context, GHG emission factors provide a consistent metric to convert the fuel/
energy used on board to transport freight or passenger into GHG emission values. The efforts 
were made previously to align the emission factors between GLEC framework and relevant IATA 
recommended practices. This was on a tank to wheel (TTW or operational emission) basis and 
only covered the CO2 component of GHG emissions. However, with  wider acknowledgement 
of well to wheel/wake, CO2e reporting, for example via the release of ISO 14083, together with 
the uptake of SAF in the aviation sector means that the time has come to realign emission 
factors across the GLEC Framework and the IATA recommended practices. There are clear 
differences between the North American and European values, stemming from multiple sources 
that may reflect geographical variations in input data and fuel production processes, as well as 
methodological differences. 

In the near short term, we believe that for aviation it would be pragmatic, to adopt a single 
set of emission factors for use irrespective of geography while efforts are ongoing to align 
the scope, input data and methodologies across emission factor databases across modes at 
international level.

Notes about main sources

ecoinvent
ecoinvent is a not-for-profit association based in Zurich, Switzerland. Its main activity is the 
publication of the ecoinvent database, which is used worldwide as a background database in 
LCA and other environmental assessments including a comprehensive set of emission factors for 
a range of energy carriers. The latest database, version 3.9.1 contains various updates including 
expanded data on the global production of natural gas and crude oil. The update also integrates 
data on the flaring of natural gas from the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) of 
the World Bank and on methane emissions from gas venting and fugitive emission source from 
the International Energy Agency’s Methane Tracker 2022. In combination with an update to the 
regional consumption mixes for crude petroleum oil to North America and Europe this has led to 
a significant change in the energy production emissions for fossil fuels.

GREET
The vast majority of the North American values are derived from the 2023 GREET model 
published by Argonne National Laboratory.9 The values in GREET are presented for the 
various phases of fuel production and use for a wide range of vehicle types.

IFEU/EcoTransIT
The applied calculation method closely follows the methodological rules of the RED and 
RED II, extending the scope from greenhouse gas emissions to include non-GHG pollutants. 
The tool used for this was created as part of the BioEm project11 and adapted for the 
purposes here in the databases. It includes direct and upstream emissions from cultivation, 
processing and transport of raw materials, intermediate products and biofuels to the filling 
station.
The BioEm tool also enables the inclusion of emissions from land-use change. However, 
this was excluded for the emission factors determined here. The reason for this is the lack of 
consensus among experts on an agreed methodological approach. This would have to be 
revised for future updates, as factors for land-use change have been recently published with 
the CORSIA emission factors,4 meaning such factors now enter into general use.

IMO MEPC 81
These  guidelines provide the GHG intensity assessment for all fuels and other energy 
carriers (e.g. electricity) used on board a ship and aim at covering the whole fuel life cycle 
(with specific boundaries) from feedstock extraction/cultivation/ recovery, feedstock 
conversion to a fuel product, transportation as well as distribution/bunkering, and fuel 
utilization on board a ship. The scope includes well-to-tank (WTT), tank-to wake (TTW), and 
well-to-wake (WTW). The GHG emissions are calculated as CO2-equivalent (CO2e), using the 
global warming potential (GWP100) as per the fifth IPCC Assessment Report,

Biofuel Blends

In many countries national regulations specify a minimum and/or maximum content of biofuel to be mixed with 
fossil fuel. It is recommended that GHG emission factors for such fuels are calculated based on the percentage 
composition of the fuel. This may be defined by energy content, volume, or mass according to the local legislation. 
Because of the variation in legislation from country to country it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of 
such emission factors. However, the following tables does provide an indication of how it would work for gasoline/
ethanol, diesel/ biodiesel and diesel/HVO blends.

Scaling emission factors: GLEC Version 3 to GLEC Version 3.1

We understand that with updated values every year in alignment with the source’s revision of the methodology 
and database, which are used in the GLEC Framework may cause a significant problem for companies that have 
already committed to certain emission reduction trajectories. It may take time for adjustment to these new values, 
as revising an emission baseline and readjusting future targets and trajectories is not a trivial process.

The following approximate scaling factors are therefore provided to help companies that calculate their emission 
using the latest European and North American values put the new values into the context of their previous baseline.

As explained in the main body of the GLEC Framework, there 
remains a need for default values as a “fall back” option in 
cases where details of contracted transport services, or access 
to primary data, is limited or unavailable. For some transport 
modes there is a vast choice of reference data and default 
values for emission intensity which can lead to comparability 
issues, whereas for other modes reference data and default 
data might be scarce, resulting in difficulties generating a 
representative output. This module contains a set of default fuel 
efficiency and GHG emission intensity values across almost all 
modes, to support consistent and comparable reporting. 

The information provided is intended to 
inform reporting by shippers or logistics 
service providers (LSPs) who want to start 
estimating and reducing their Scope 3 
GHG emissions from transporting cargo as 
part of their inbound or outbound supply 
chains, before progressing to using more 
accurate approaches.

The results are presented as a set of tiered 
levels of detail. These levels are designed 
to match the level of understanding of 
potential users of the information. Up to 
three levels of detail have been provided 
for each mode.

1. A single, conservative value where the 
user’s knowledge is highly limited, often 
to the mode of transport used with little, if 
any, additional information.
2. A basic level of disaggregation where 
a service type is known, but detailed 
information of the vehicle or operational 
characteristics, which could help refine the 
value used, remains unknown.
3. A more granular set of values, for use 
where some knowledge about the vehicle 
type, vehicle size and fuel exists.

•  There are some variations in the approach    
  taken or the data available for emission  
  calculation by global geographic region.

•  Unless specified otherwise, values are  
  globally applicable.

Taking this approach also allows a comparison 
of representative values across and within 
modes at a general level. The following graph 
shows a high-level comparison of the possible 
range of emission intensities associated with 
each mode. 

The values are drawn from the broader 
database that informs the values presented 
for each mode on the subsequent pages and 

Module 2

and GHG emission

should only be considered as indicative.

A very wide range is possible within each 
mode, depending on the specific operational 
and technical characteristics of the individual 
transport, although general trends are also 
clearly visible. Four more specific examples 
have been added for road transport to show 
how, even within sub-classes, wide variations 
are still possible, which again emphasizes 
the need to define the specific nature of the 
transport as closely as possible to obtain an 
accurate output.

Technically it would be possible to provide a 
very detailed set of default values that takes 
into consideration a wide variation in load 
factors, cargo types, fuel mixes, regional 
variations etc. However, we believe that 
producing such a list would be misleading, 
because it would imply a level of precision 
that is inappropriate to its likely subsequent 
use, as default values can only provide an 
indication of emissions. The results generated 
by using such values might therefore create 
wrong impressions regarding inefficiencies 
and emissions of your specific organization. 
Furthermore, they could discourage 
organizations from progressing toward the use 
of higher quality data in the form of detailed 
modeling, or, preferably, good quality primary 
data, which is better suited to decision-making 
in support of emission reduction.

To put this another way, we hope that, in time, 
the default values provided here will no longer 
be needed because, increasingly, organizations 
will have enough information to use high-quality 
emissions modeling or verified primary data 
sources to support precise reporting and 
better-informed emission reduction decisions.
The GLEC default factors have been produced 
with certain constraints in mind, particularly:

•  The default values quoted are, to the best of 
  our knowledge, conservative: in most cases 
  they are likely to give a higher value than 
  if primary data is used in a calculation. The 
  reasoning behind this is that there should not 
  be a penalty in terms of an increase  
  in reported emissions when a company 
  progresses to the use of more precise 
  input data.

•  Among the many sets of default values that 
  have been published over the years there 
  are some that carry legal weight. For 
  example, the Base Carbone data in France 
  and the “Guideline for Shipper Energy 
  Conservation Action” in Japan contain energy  
  intensity values that are embedded within 
  national emission reporting legislation, and 
  as such are required to be used for estimation 
  of emissions from domestic transportation by 
  companies based in those countries.

•  The values are generally quoted to a limited 
  number of significant figures in order to  
  emphasize that they only provide estimates of  
  Scope 3 GHG emissions. As stated in 
  the main body of the Framework, Scope 1 
  emissions, or attempts to calculate accurate 
  Scope 3 emission values, should be based 
  on a more sophisticated approach, for 
  example, using verified primary data and/or  
  a certified calculation tool.

•  Justification as to data sources, operational  
  assumptions and choices made has been 
  provided to a level considered appropriate  
  for an industry-led initiative. The GLEC default  
  factors are not a peer-reviewed, scientific 
  publication but rather our best attempt to 
  provide reliable estimates as a first step on 
  a company’s journey to inclusive, high-quality 
  GHG emission reporting. That said, this 
  module will continue to be updated when 
  new datasets become available for inclusion,  
  as harmonization or standards are adopted,  
  and as understanding improves over time.

Air transport

Many factors influence the emissions from air transportation, 
not least the aircraft type and detailed routing which may not be 
immediately apparent. The following default emission intensity 
values have been produced for air freight transport to provide 
LSPs and shippers with indicative values for their reporting of 
Scope 3 emissions where primary data is not available from the 
airline, or there is insufficient information (e.g., specific aircraft 
type or load factor are unknown) to allow detailed modeling of 
the emissions.

Since publication of the GLEC Framework 
v2 in 2019, the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) has updated its methodology 
guidance for partitioning of emissions between 
passengers and belly cargo so that there is 
currently consistency between IATA RP 1678, 
ISO 14083 and the European Union Emissions 
Trading System (EU ETS). Although there is still 
some debate as to whether this may be further 
updated, it is the approach represented in 
these GLEC emission intensities.
Emissions are quoted on a WTW, CO2e basis, 
using the fuel emission factor for jet fuel quoted 
in Module 1 of the Framework. 

In compiling the following air freight default 
values, several possible data sources were 
identified which produced or quoted widely 

varying values. Based on discussion with 
various stakeholders the following approach 
has been used:

Values of aircraft fuel consumption, both 
freight and passenger aircraft, were calculated 
for routes indicative of both short- and long-
haul air transport, following the definitions 
used by Science-Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) and in ISO 14083, using information 
provided in the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation (ICAO) Carbon Emissions 
Calculator Methodology Version 11.12 
Additionally, a set of values is provided for 
companies that are unable to determine 
whether their air freight has been transported 
as belly freight or on a freighter. This has been 
calculated as a weighted average of the belly 

Module 2
Default fuel efficiency 
and GHG emission 
Intensity values

3

Aim higher

freight and freighter values in the ratio 55% 
belly freight, 45% freighter.

The fuel consumption has been converted 
into an emission intensity value for each 
aircraft type and route combination using the 
latest IATA average values for passenger and 
freight load factors. For the purpose of this 
default calculation, the currently low average 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) content of 
aviation fuel has been excluded to avoid even 
the marginal risk of double counting where 
an airline is able to report a figure based on 
primary data that reflects known SAF use.

We understand that this is a simplification, 
because overall fuel, and hence emission 
intensity, varies steadily with distance for any 
particular aircraft and loading condition. We also 
recognize that there is not a single definition of 
the terms, short- and long-haul. These are all 
indications as to why it would be better to rely on 
either verified airline data or detailed modeling 
from a reputable source than these default data.

Air Freight emission intensity values include 
a +95km distance conversion to account for 
emissions related to diversionary and/or out-of-
route distances.

These values were then validated through 
private communications with GLEC member 
companies that operate their own aircraft fleets.

Bearing in mind all these caveats the proposed 
air sector defaults are as follows:

Inland waterway 
transport

Although the following emission intensities are proposed 
as global values, the data is primarily based on European 
operational information on major waterways and combined 
according to weighted averages for common vessel categories.

The nature of the waterway system has a 
significant impact both on the type and size 
of vessel that can navigate it and the ease 
of transit due to the prevalence of locks, 
underwater clearance and speed of flow. 
Generic information does not reflect the specific 
situation. It is therefore important that you base 
your calculations on good quality primary data.
Failing that, inland waterway or country-specific 
data should be sought wherever possible.

The value for the smallest vessel size 
category in Table 2 is drawn from the Base 
Carbone database,13 which contains values 
generated from national operational data 
for France that generally suggest a higher 
energy and emission intensity than the rest 
of the more general European data that is 
used to populate the rest of the table.

The development of default emission intensities for logistics hubs 
is still at a relatively early stage. To overcome the data gap on 
operational GHG emissions of logistics hubs, the international 
partners of the GILA project – Fraunhofer IML, Politecnico di 
Milano, GreenRouter and Universidad de los Andes – organized 
market studies to update their initial data base on GHG emission 
intensity values of logistics hubs.14

As a result of this collaboration and previous 
work, an expanded set of default emission 
intensity values for a more disaggregated range 
of logistics hubs has been produced and is 
presented in Table 3. 

The underlying data, i.e., annual information on 
energy consumption, refill of refrigerants and 
throughput, collected by each institution were 
processed, anonymized and finally merged into 
one database from which the final emission 
intensities per hub were calculated. This 
database differentiates five hub types, as follows: 
1. Hubs where transshipment is the main service 
(>80% of goods handled); 
2. Hubs where both transshipment and 
warehousing are relevant services; 
3. Hubs where warehousing is the main service 
(>80% of goods handled); 
4. Liquid bulk terminals; 
5. Maritime container terminals. 

As an additional categorization, the site
conditions have been classified as ambient, 

temperature-controlled or mixed sites. Table 
3 summarizes current average emission 
intensity values of the defined hub types. The 
corresponding sample size per hub type is 
outlined in brackets. While data on terminals 
originate from various regions worldwide, the 
main focus for warehouses and transshipment 
sites is Europe. Further background information 
on the calculations can be found on the REff 
Tool® website via https://s.fhg.de/reff. 

Values quoted are the median value from 
each sample which was considered more 
representative than the mean for small sample 
sizes with large variations and some apparent 
outliers. The hub sizes vary from a few tonnes 
to more than 1.7 million tonnes outbound, with 
around 70,000 tonnes as median value for 
storage and transshipment sites and 250 tonnes 
to 23 million tonnes with a median value of 
650,000 tonnes for liquid bulk terminals. 22% of 
the operators specified a site-specific electricity 
mix. However, only an average national 
emission factor was used for calculating the 

average emission intensity specified in the 
table. Natural gas is the main heating energy 
source; liquid bulk terminals also use steam 
for heating purposes. Energy sources for 
non-electrified material handling are diesel, 
biodiesel-blends, petrol, propane or LPG. The 
refrigerant types R-410A, R-404A and R-717 are 
the most frequently used ones as specified by 
the participating sites. 

The sample size that these values are based on 
is still relatively small; the values will continue 
to be updated over time assuming that more 
and better data becomes available and is 
shared with Fraunhofer IML. We expect this to 
improve accuracy and to broaden the range of 
defaults offered, e.g., additional definitions and 
size categorization of logistics hubs or values 
for specific regions where ambient climate 
conditions can have a strong influence on the 
amount of heating or cooling required. As is the 
case for all default values, the data in Table 3 
should be used as a last resort when primary 
data is not available, or as a starting point that 

can lead on to future calculations based on 
primary data. If you, as a logistics hubs operator, 
are not happy for your customers to use the 
values quoted then the onus is on you to provide 
them with more accurate information based on 
primary data and calculations that follow the 
Fraunhofer IML “Guide for Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions Accounting at Logistics Hubs.”15 

Future Development 

Fraunhofer IML is working in partnership with 
SFC and other organizations to attempt to build 
a broader GILA database of hub emissions, from 
which better knowledge of emission reduction 
opportunities and a wider range of default values 
will become available, e.g., in terms of regional 
differences. This is achieved through application 
of the REff Tool®, which is provided online via 
https://s.fhg.de/reff. To participate in this work, 
please contact either contact-reff@iml.fraunhofer.

hubs activity data to help grow this knowledge

Information is collected, aggregated and 
published through the American Association of 
Railroads in the form of revenue ton-mile output 
per gallon of fuel used, following the Eastern 
Regional Technical Advisory Committee (ERTAC) 
methodology. Conversion to the common units 
used in the GLEC Framework, and conversion 
using the latest GREET fuel emission factors,

the data in the primary inputs are arranged in a different way.

The primary inputs used are:

1. SmartWay truck data 2023 for North America19
2. Handbook of Emission Factors (HBEFA) database values20
processed internally by SFC to approximate the current (2024) 
typical operational parameters of each truck type and size
3. UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting21 
4. Base Carbone, as used in application of article L. 1431-313

* The SmartWay Category designation for each fleet is based on the 
Operation and Body Type options selected by the carrier when entering 
data into the SmartWay database.

Data is sourced from US EPA SmartWay, except that for van, which is 
sourced from NTM. Fleets are characterized by:
1. Business type: for-hire and private fleets. There are relatively few 
private fleets compared to for-hire fleets; generally, the private fleets 
are well used and so not detrimental to the overall value if included with 
the for-hire fleets; hence, for simplicity, no differentiation is made. 
2. Operational type: Full Truckload (FTL), Less than Truckload (LTL), 
dray, expedited or package;
3. Equipment type, relating to the type of cargo carried: dry truck (or 
van), temperature-controlled truck (or van), flatbed, chassis (container), 
heavy/bulk, auto carrier, moving and specialized (e.g., hopper, 

livestock.) Fleets can be classified as “mixed” if they have 
more than a set percentage of its operational mileage outside 
of one particular service or equipment category.
4. Current year averages for empty running and load factor 
based on primary data inputted by carriers into the SmartWay 
tool, and hence implicitly included in the calculations, are not 
publicly available.

The dry truck category and chassis (or intermodal container) 
category are combined in SmartWay as similar operational 
characteristics exist.

Most temperature-controlled fleets are FTL with relatively 
fewer LTL so this category is also combined.

For users who have little knowledge other than 
a basic vehicle type, the starting points for 
vehicles without temperature control would be:
• Van (<3.5 t Gross vehicle weight (GVW)): 
  840 g CO2e/t-km (WTW)
• Urban truck (3.5-7.5 t GVW): 335 g 
  CO2e/t-km (WTW)
• MGV (7.5-20 t GVW): 210 g CO2e/t-km (WTW)
• HGV: (>20 t GVW): 125 g CO2e/t-km (WTW)

Each of these values is based on a particular 
set of assumptions and chosen from the much 
larger set of possibilities available in the full 
dataset below. As explained in the introduction 
the choice is highly unlikely to be “right” (i.e., 
highly accurate) for the majority of applications, 
but can be considered suitable as a starting 
point where there is little detailed knowledge.
Where there is a greater level of knowledge 
about the vehicle and fuel type, the following, 
disaggregated values can be used. 

Road Freight emission intensity values include 
a + 5% distance conversion to account for 
emissions related to diversionary and/or out-of-
route distances

The default emission intensities for road freight 
transport are calculated using the same approach 
used by national reference databases such as 
HBEFA, [France] and Great Britain. That is, for 
a given driving cycle the fuel consumption for 
a vehicle when empty and when fully laden are 
used as the two extremes with a linear relationship 
between the two depending on loading.  We have 
selected a typical drive cycle for each vehicle size 
category together with the fuel consumptions 
associated with it, using HBEFA database as the 
most comprehensive and representative reference 
option for Europe.  

Typical levels of loading and empty running, 
as shown in tables 7-11, are factored into the 
calculation. The age profile used for each vehicle 
type is that of a 5 year old vehicle to avoid overly 
positive fuel consumption of new vehicles that 
would not be representative of the whole fleet.

Bio-LNG based on GHG reduction threshold 
is to be qualified under RED II.8 Lower 
values are possible depending on feedstock, 
production pathway and blending of 
sources and can be used where reputable 
certification is available.

The main source for the European data 
is HBEFA19.The data has been chosen to 
reflect the current average fleet age and 
modified to match the typical operating 
profile for each vehicle. This means it is not 
a direct representation of a single HBEFA 
scenario. Specifically, it is not based on 
the newest vehicle specifications because 
this would misrepresent the fact that there 
is a significant proportion of older vehicles 
operating in the overall fleet. Emissions 
are based on the latest European emission 
factors presented in Module 1.

The below set of China Road emission 
intensity default values was first published 
in the China Default GHG Emission Values 
V1.0 report(2024)30. With the GLEC FW 
v3.1 update, we applied + 5% distance 
conversion to correct for the difference 
between actual and shortest feasible 
distance.

The main source of the fuel efficiency and 
transport activity and performance data 
(e.g., distance, load factor, empty running 
rate) is from Xi’an Jiaotong University’s 
report “Preliminary Investigation and 
Research on Freight Industry”31. The 
calculation of road emission intensity factors 
follows mainly the 2006 IPCC Guidance32, 
GHG Protocol, and GLEC Framework, as 
well as China’s national-level and industry 
standards regarding transport GHGs 
accounting and report, e.g., NDRC’s 
“GHGs Accounting Methods and Reporting 
Guidelines for Land Transport Enterprises”33. 
Other sources related to calculations 
including WB/T 1135-2023 (2023.7)

Sea transport 
emission intensities

Data is based on information presented in the Fourth (IMO) 
Greenhouse Gas Study23. The starting point is the median 
fuel consumption for each size category with the addition 
of 10%, which equals the range between lower and upper 
quartile values, to avoid a risk of underestimation. Emissions 
are based on the latest North American emission factors 
presented in Module 1.

Values for Tanker, General cargo and 
Bulk carrier are derived from IMO Fourth 
GHG study.

Ro-Ro: Tonne-kilometer in these 
circumstances refers to the gross load of 
truck and cargo contained, as this is the 
cargo transported by the vessel. These 
emissions will need to be reallocated to the 
cargo in the truck by the cargo owner. 

Non-container shipping freight emission 
intensity values include a + 15% distance 
conversion to correct for the difference 
between the actual and the shortest 
feasible distance.

Module 2
Default fuel efficiency

Intensity values

All the end user values for containerized 
shipping are calculated according to the stages 
presented in the CCWG methodology.24 The 
values are on a WTW CO2e basis, based on 
a 70% industry average load factor and the 
end user factors include a + 15% distance 
conversion to correct for the difference 
between actual and shortest feasible distance.

The values have been adjusted to take account 
of the latest North American emission factors 
presented in Module 1. Hence, the values are 
marginally higher than the values shown in the 
Clean Cargo 2022 annual report.

Default maritime container end user factors are 
derived from the latest Clean Cargo trade lane 
GHG emission factors (reporting year 2023.) 
Three levels of details are presented depending 
on the level of information about origin and 
destination known to the user:
• The overall Clean Cargo Working Group  
  (CCWG) industry average
• Five sets of aggregated data for major trade  
  lane groupings (see figure below) based on a  
  weighted average of flows on the detailed  
  trade lanes included within each grouping.
• The full set of CCWG trade lanes

Module 4 
Examples of 
emission calculations 
- step-by-step

This Module contains examples of transport chains and 
explains – step by step – how to calculate their emissions. 
Using the most prevalent modes of transport and 
combinations of them (multi-modal transport), we guide 
you through the use of the GLEC Framework.

The examples are developed in such a 
way that they best cover the different 
calculation needs of the various actors in 
the supply chain, taking into consideration 
different levels of access to primary data. 
For the examples we use actors of different 
size with different shares of emissions in 
the overall carbon footprint of the transport 
chain, and with different requirements 
towards the granularity of the calculation. 
This ensures that you get scenarios which 
are as realistic as possible. 

Furthermore, the examples cover different 
use cases of the calculation: they may be 
part of a (company) carbon footprint or a 
specified project, an impact analysis and/
or part of a target setting and tracking 
assessment. 

As mentioned throughout the GLEC 
Framework, measured (primary) data is 
preferred to default values. For distances 
always use the shortest feasible distance 
(SFD) or Great Circle Distance (GCD) 
wherever possible.

1. Calculation of GHG emissions 
from road transport

Road transport chain elements often occur as 
part of transport chains with several transport 
chain elements (TCEs). These TCEs can be 
with other modes of transport where the road 
transport builds the first leg pick-up and last leg 
delivery service; also the road TCE can be part 
of a more or less complex network consisting 
solely of road TCEs.

The application of ISO 14083 follows the 
general calculation steps set out in Section 1 of 
the GLEC Framework. Therefore, TCEs must be 
identified for each consignment separately. As 
the number of consignments can be very high 
in a dense and large road transport network, it 
is recommended to use transport management 
systems (TMS) as the basis for routing 
information: transport flows and their distances 
are stored in TMS, and the events created by 
the scans of shipments at a hub or terminal 
usually indicate the start or end of a TCE. TMS 
therefore provide a good source for transport 
distances at a consignment level. The preferred 
transport distance type to be used in the GLEC 
Framework is the SFD, which can be identified 
per TCE from the TMS or the route planner. 
In exceptions GCD can be used (please see 
Section 1 for further information.)

Transport activity for each consignment is 
calculated by multiplying the consignment’s 
mass by the TCE distance. Next, all transport 
activities of each journey are added up to build 
the transport activity of the related transport 
operation categories (TOC). 

Aim higher

Then the GHG emission intensity of the TOC 
can be calculated.

Figure 1
Example of a road transport chain

Example:
If an average of 0.15l “diesel” is consumed per 
tkm in a TOC, the associated GHG emission 
intensity when using a typical WTW diesel 
emission factor for Europe, which includes 5% 
biodiesel, would be:

0.15 l x 3.36 kg/l CO2e = 0.504 kg CO2e 
per tkm

1.1 Company’s own vehicle fleet emission 
calculations and derived emission intensities

To calculate the GHG emissions for a specific 
consignment on a TCE associated with the 
above TOC, its emission intensity must be 
multiplied by the TCE’s specific consignment 
mass and activity distance. So, if the 
consignment mass is 450kg and the distance 
20km then, for the above example, the total 
emissions for the consignment on this TCE 
would be:

0.45 t x 20 km x 0.504 kg CO2e per tkm = 
4.54 kg CO2e

The following calculation examples illustrate 
different angles and use cases, always 
applying the same logic, starting with a basic 
use case with access to all relevant GHG 
activity data (fuel use, refrigerant use etc.), 
progressing up to more complex transport 
operations with less access to primary data.

In the following examples, the company has 
the objective of calculating its own footprint. 
The related reporting is intended for use by 
the company itself for gaining insight into its 
carbon footprint as well as by its suppliers and 
customers who want to include the reported 
values in their supply chain emission reporting.

Given the structure of road transport with its 
high number of consignments, TCEs in road 
transport are the journey segments along 
a specific route, from point of departure to 
destination which an operator consolidates in 
its vehicle fleet operation, including terminal/
hub handling and transshipments. 

NOTE: Consignments consolidated into mixed 
loads like these need to be captured by their 
actual mass, not chargeable weights, including 
packaging but excluding separate load carriers 
like pallets, metal cages etc., unless tied to the 
consignments by the original consignor. 

As routes and tours are usually kept in a TMS 
or planning system, their distances in a period 
of time (usually one year) should be known. 
This distance (km) per route or tour (TCE) 
multiplied by the mass of freight gives the 
transport activity (tkm) of the TCE.

Example:
On the route Hamburg-Munich a total cargo 
mass of 1,200 tonnes is transported during one 
year. The TMS gives an SFD of 658 km. Then 
the total tkm of this route can be calculated as:

658 km x 1,200 t = 789,600 tkm

In case you do not have access to this data 
from a TMS, the best workaround is to capture 
total distance on each route and the average 
load (tonnes) per vehicle class: e.g., in case the 
40t trucks in a pool carry 15 tonnes on average 
and these (e.g., 10) trucks are operating in total 
1,000,000 loaded kilometers per year, their total 
transport activity would be calculated as: 

1,000,000 km x 15 t = 15,000,000 tkm

114

A TOC is always a group of vehicles and 
associated operations that share the same 
characteristics (e.g., same vehicle size classes 
with same temperature condition). TOCs are 
formed to reflect the transport operations of 
each TCE.

The transport operator needs to take care that 
the choices made in defining the TOCs are 
meaningful and relevant for its own decisions 
and those of its clients. It is recommended to 
check the TOC creation and granularity level 

with the most important clients. Furthermore, it 
is recommended to always separate transport 
activity and associated emissions of different 
temperature conditions, as these are different 
services for which different carbon intensities 
need to be calculated and made transparent (to 
clients, for own efficiency controls). Here you 
find an overview of example parameters for TOC 
creation and granularity levels. Flexibility exists 
to merge or subdivide these examples to match 
the granularity to the needs of the calculation.

Based on this table, examples for TOCs in road 
transport include:

• An individual vehicle on a specific route,  
  outbound and return
• An individual vehicle in a specific network
• Vehicles of a specific type in a fleet if they  
  share similar or even identical characteristics,  
  e.g. temperature controlled, on a specific  
  route, outbound and return
•  Vehicles of a specific type in a fleet  
  if they share similar or even identical  
  characteristics, on all routes operated by a  
  specific organization
•  ……

When it comes to the TOC level, transport 
activity (tkm) needs to be calculated separately 
per TOC to ensure that the correct emission 
intensities of each operation category are 
applied: e.g., per vehicle size class, route type, 
ambient vs. temperature controlled, etc. To 
simplify calculations, all similar TOCs (e.g., same 
vehicle size classes with same temperature 
condition) can be clustered and their energy use 
can be summed up.  For example:

• All energy use in size class X, driven ambient =  
  total liters of fuel
• All energy use in size class Y, driven ambient =  
  total liters of fuel
• All energy use in size class Y, driven with  
  temperature condition I = total liters of fuel  
  (diesel)
• All energy use in size class Y, driven with  
  temperature condition I = total kWh (BEV)
• ….

emission calculations 
- step-by-step

Once all energy use is identified, the data 
can be allocated to the TOCs, at the chosen 
level of aggregation and depending on the 
granularity you aim for.  In Section 3 Module 1 
all associated emission factors can be found for 
diesel (EU average, US average or composed 
with a respective biofuel blend) and electricity 
emission factors.

Once the calculated transport activity (tkm) 
is matched to the energy use and associated 
emissions per TOC, in the chosen granularity, 
you can calculate the emission intensity and 
emissions of the TOC:

Emission intensity (CO2e/tkm) = GHG 
emissions per tkm at the level of granularity 
chosen for the TOC.

Total emissions (CO2e) = GHG emissions per 
TOC = all energy use per TOC multiplied by the 
appropriate emission factor.

Example calculations for different energy 
sources used:

Module 1 is equivalent to 356.4 g/kWh CO2e.)
= 35,640 kg CO2e. 

• For total emissions in diesel vehicles: 
all liters of fuel multiplied by the WTW emission 
factor in kg CO2e/l (see Module 1 of GLEC 
Framework for example values that follow the 
ISO 14083 methodology) = total WTW emissions 
in kg CO2e

Example: 
100,000 liters diesel/5% biodiesel blend 
consumed in Europe multiplied by the emission 
factor of 3.36 kg/l (see GLEC Framework 
emission factor in Module 1)
= 336,000 kg (or 336 tonnes) of CO2e for this 
amount of fuel

• For total emissions in battery electric 
vehicles: 
all kWh of electricity multiplied by the emission 
factor in kg CO2e/kWh applicable for the country 
(location based) or any market-based green 
electricity provision = total WTW emissions in 
kg CO2e

Example: 
100,000 kWh electricity consumed in Europe 
multiplied by the factor of 356.4 g/kWh CO2e 
(The EU average value of 99 g/MJ CO2e from 

NOTE: It is important that any different, 
market-based emission factors are 
independently certified.
• For total emissions in hybrid vehicles: 
Diesel consumption in liters multiplied by the 
respective emission factor + energy use in kWh 
electricity multiplied by the respective emission 
factor = WTW CO2e emissions from diesel + 
WTW CO2e emissions from electricity.

Example: 
Hybrid energy use is composed of 100,000 
liters of diesel/5% biodiesel blend and 100,000 
kWh of electricity. Using the above European 
emission factors for diesel and electricity, 
the calculation would be the same as above, 
resulting in 336,000 kg of CO2e from diesel 
consumption + 35,640 kg of CO2e from 
electricity use, giving a total of 371,640 kg CO2e.

1.2  EV operations emission intensity TOC

Calculations for EV operations should consider 
both electricity emission factor and potential 
losses at specific charging locations as shown 
in figure 1.

In EV Fleet operations, charging is often done 
at various locations, considering regional and 
long-haul scenarios, for example, in long-haul 
operations, carriers are expected to charge at 
their trucks depot overnight, however, additional 
charging to extend driving ranges may occur 
at destinations during loading or unloading or 
en-route at public or highway charging stations, 
potentially in different countries.

TOC of EV operations include:
• the average grid electricity mixes of countries  
  where charging activity takes place,
• average energy contribution by behind-the-   
  meter power generation, such as the facility’s  
  solar panels, and 
• the on-site electrical and charging    
  infrastructure layout

estimate, we recommend using a conservative 
value of 1.11 to represent losses of 90% from 
meter to vehicle.

Corrected emission factor associated with the 
charging location is multiplication of both the 
net electricity emission factor and  the charging 
location correction factor.

Corrected emission factor = Net emission factor *  Energy correction factor

Considering these factors, we propose two 
additional variables to be included in calculation.

Based on the above data, calculation amounts 
to 129 g/kWh. If the energy intensity of the fleet 
is taken as 0.17 kWh/tkm, the TOC emission 
intensity can be calculated as 22 g/tkm. In the 
normal methodology used by carriers or shippers, 
take the reported TOC emission intensity and 
multiply it by that TOC’s annual transport activity 
to calculate the annual emissions of the EV 
operations.

1.3 Refrigerants

Replenishment of any refrigerant losses needs 
to be allocated on top of the energy-based GHG 
emissions for temperature-controlled services. 
Hence the coverage of the calculation is: 

All fuel consumption converted to WTW GHG 
emissions (mass of CO2e) + all refrigerant-loss-
related GHG emissions (tonnes or kg). You will 
find the respective emission factors in Module 3. 
If the refrigerant type is unknown, you may apply 
the respective default factor.

Where there are different temperature conditions 
that lead to different rates of fuel use (and 
there may also be different refrigerant types), 
the calculations need to be carried out 
separately per temperature condition for 
each transport activity.

Example:
In the TOC for temperature condition A, 
6,000,000 tkm have been operated by 10 
trucks with mobile refrigerant units. The 
average volume of the applied refrigerant for air 
conditioning units is, using ISO 14083 default 
factors, 1.5 kg charge capacity, with a default 
loss of 15% = 0.225 kg per unit, and for a 
temperature-controlled mobile freight unit by 
default 5.5 kg charge capacity, with a default 
loss of 32.5% = 1.787 kg per unit.

This results in a refrigerant loss for the 
10 trucks of 
2.25 kg + 17.87 kg = 20.12 kg 

The total of 28,771.6 kg CO2e emissions of 
refrigerant losses for all 10 trucks would result 
in an additional GHG emissions of 0.0048 kg 
CO2e per tkm.

NOTE: Where different refrigerants are used in 
one transport, different emission factors for the 
leakages must be applied.

1.4 Inclusion of HOC emissions

In order to integrate HOC emissions, all 
terminal/hub energy consumption which is 
related to the hub operation activities carried 
out to the freight, needs to be identified per 
HOC type: e.g. ambient vs. temperature-
controlled terminal spaces.

To calculate the total emissions of a transport 
chain the emissions for all transport and hub 
related TCEs need to be added together.

1.5 Collection and delivery rounds

Collection and delivery rounds that consist of 
a roundtrip (or “milkrun”) with several stops 
where cargo is picked up and/or delivered 
may be considered just like any other journey. 
However, information on the routing and 
distance between the stops and the respective 
load levels along the journey may not always 
be available. Furthermore, the actual transport 
may be carried out differently day by day, 
depending on demand (amount and location of 
stops) and other circumstances such as road 
congestion, lead time slots etc.

This loss of 20.12 kg needs to be applied across 
the 6,000,000 tkm to ensure the additional GHG 
emissions caused by this transport activity due 
to the temperature condition A are included. 
Where the same refrigerant is used, the same 
emission factor applies:

The preferred option, assuming a full set of 
information, is to distribute the calculated 
emissions for the delivery round according 
to the transport activity share of the notional 
point-to-point trips that have been replaced by 
the round trip. 

If refrigerant R-134a, with an emission factor 
of 1,430 kg CO2e/kg is used, this would result 
in 321.75 kg CO2e for each air-conditioned 
unit, and a further 2,555.41 kg CO2e for each 
temperature-controlled mobile freight unit. 

Example:
A vehicle leaves the base fully loaded and 
returns to base empty having dropped off 
loads at 5 intermediate stops.

Aim higher

This example shows that the cumulative 
distance driven of the round trip (in this case, a 
total of 30 km) can easily be much shorter than 
the total return trip distance of the individual 
trips that have been replaced, leading to greater 
efficiency and lower overall emissions.

trip. This has the benefit of providing stability to 
the calculation, does not penalize a delivery that 
is made towards the end of the delivery round 
and eliminates the variability that comes from 
schedules that change on a daily basis.

The preferred option to distribute a “fair” share 
of the emissions in a roundtrip, is to distribute 
the total GHG emissions of the entire round 
according to each delivery’s share of notional 
point-to-point transport activity. In the above 
example this would mean distributing the 
emissions caused by the 30-km roundtrip 
based on the notional point-to-point transport 
activities that have been replaced by the round 

Table 2
Example of a road transport routing

In cases where individual delivery locations or 
item masses are not tracked, options include 
calculating the emissions for the round trip based 
on fuel consumption and then allocating the 
emissions based on a typical item mass for the 
specific operation in question (if actual mass is 
not known) or calculating the emissions on a 
per-item basis, which may be a more suitable 
approach for the mail sector where deliveries are 
not tracked in an often dense distribution network.

1.6 Special case: mail and parcel services

Characteristics of the transport of mail and 
parcel services are that letters and parcels are 
not transported individually. The mail and parcel 
business often takes place on flexible routes and 
with several consolidations on a journey and it 
is not possible to track distances individually 
per letter or parcel. Mail items usually have very 
little mass (0.02–0.1 kg), yet their mass may vary 
from 20 g up to 32 kg and it is difficult to track 
individual consignment mass. 

However, it is essential to use an indicator 
that reflects operations in a meaningful and 
pragmatic way. The mail and parcel sector is in 
the process of evaluating suitable categories for 
mail and parcels.

Until a better solution is identified and brought 
into line with ISO 14083, the emissions per item 
are therefore calculated by dividing the total 
emissions of a TCE (GHG activity) by number of 
items, to arrive at a carbon intensity.

Where the parcel mass is known, a more 
specific approach can be taken. The purpose of 
the following example is to show the difference 
in application between the generic or the more 
specific weight-based approach, in particular its 
impact on the first and last mile of the delivery.

Example: (example from GLEC Framework v.2, 
updated to take into account revised emission 
factors)

In the following situation a 250 g package is 
collected from the sender as part of a tracked 
collection round, inserted into a consolidated, 
international mail and parcels network, and 
delivered as part of a general, untracked 
delivery network.

The above information would apply irrespective 
of the approach used for the collection and 
delivery rounds.

Table 4
Example of a mail and parcel transport 
chain emission calculation

The final task is to calculate the values for TCE 
1 and 9, figuring as A and B in Table 3. The 
following calculations show how this could be 
done for both situations: tracked, in this case a 
collection round, and untracked, in the above 
example a delivery round.

TCE1: the tracked collection round

For the tracked collection round the assumption 
is that the following information exists or can be 
calculated based on primary data:

• total fuel consumption for the collection round
• SFD between the logistics site and each  
  individual collection point
• mass of each individual item, including  
  packaging
• emission factor to convert fuel to GHG  
  emissions

In the table opposite, 14 collections are shown. 
The 250 g item that is the focus of this example 
is collection number 7.

The allocation of emissions is based on the 
percentage share of the direct tonne-kilometers 
for each collected item. So, the 250 g item at 
row 7 gets 0.0024/0.3631 as its share of the total 
emissions (0.7%).

The emission factor used to convert 4.8 liters to 
15.734 kg CO2e is the US WTW value for diesel 
fuel from Module 1.

TCE 9: Untracked delivery round

Table 5
Example of a mail and parcel transport chain by TCEs

For the untracked delivery round the data 
requirement is less complex and relates to the 
following items:

• total fuel for the delivery round, 
• number of items delivered 
• emission factor to convert fuel to emissions

For the example, the 250 g item is one of 275 
items delivered as part of an entire mail delivery 
round.

The total fuel consumption is 7.3 liters

Fuel per item is therefore
7.3l/275 = 0.02655l/item

The GHG emissions per item are as follows:
• Energy provision emissions (WTT): 0.0220kg   
CO2e/item
• Operational emissions (TTW): 0.0659 kg CO2e/ 
  item
• Total emissions (WTW): 0.0880 kg CO2e/item
  using the EU average WTW value for a 7%  
  biodiesel/diesel blend

The information is now available to insert 
values A (TCE1) and B (TCE9) into the overall 
calculation framework, leading to the following 
completed calculation (see Table 5).

The total WTW emissions for the 250 g package 
in this example along its full route are 0.875 
kg CO2e; of which 77.2% result from the air 
transportation main haul.

1.6 Limited data access, mix of primary 
and secondary data

It is not always possible to source all necessary 
data in the form of primary data. Where primary 
data for energy consumption or transport activity 
data (cargo mass and distances on consignment 
level) are not available, these need to be derived 
in the form of secondary data, as modeled or 
default data.

Examples: 
If a company has very good data on most 
linehaul operations but not on the first or 
last mile delivery, it can get this data or at 
least a representative example as a basis for 
modeling data from contracted carriers. If these 
contracted carriers are not able to provide 
such data or do not account for a significant 
amount of data (the threshold depends on the 
assessed impact the lack of such data has on 
the final emission results), proxy data needs to 
be collected, e.g., in the form of information on 
fleet composition from country authorities or 
acknowledged databases. As far as information 
on average filling rates is concerned, default 
data from Section 3 Module 2 may be used, 
depending on the cargo mix carried.

If a company operates in countries where 
there are no statistics on fleet operation and 
the infrastructure is not comparable to those 
for which sufficient data is publicly available, 
studies or data on the transport structure and 
average fleet of such country needs to be 
obtained (e.g., from the International Transport 
Forum (ITF) or the International Council of Clean 
Transportation (ICCT)). If such studies suggest 
that the country’s infrastructure resembles one 

of developed countries 5‒10 years ago, older 
versions of HBEFA may be checked for suitable 
data. Alternatively, local data needs to be 
tracked which may entail dedicated projects.
In case there is no fuel consumption data 
available, then the fuel/energy consumption and 
related GHG activity need to be derived solely 
from the transport activity: 

• the sum of freight mass (tonnes) multiplied  
  by the activity distance (km) multiplied by the  
  emission intensity of a modeled TOC 

or, failing that, the most appropriate available 
default emission intensity may be used.

Example:
HBEFA provides a very granular database of 
default values for vehicle fuel consumption. It 
takes into consideration the most emission-
sensitive parameters. These conditions may 
be remodeled (by a tool) whereas the actual 
activity (route in region X with street category 
Y etc.) is mirrored by the respective parameter 
combination in the database. For example, 
if a transport from Munich to Hamburg in 
Germany needs to be modeled, the average 
vehicle size operating on that route is taken as 
basic reference (40t truck, Euro class 6) and 
related parameters are chosen: 60% filling rate, 
17% empty trip, 95% highway share, medium 
congestion, hilly topography. This combination 
would lead to a certain fuel/energy consumption 
which is then applied as the TOC emission 
intensity value (CO2e g/tkm WTW).

Alternatively, if primary data for modeling 
emission intensities is not available, or 
the respective tool does not combine the 

Module 4 
Examples of 
emission calculations 
- step-by-step

parameters case by case bottom up, a default 
value may be used. When choosing a default 
value, it is important that the characteristics of 
the actual transport match as closely as possible 
the assumptions that are behind the calculation 
of the default values. 

Figure 3 shows the impact that vehicle size, load 
factor and share of empty runs can have on the 
resulting emission intensity. This shows how 

important it is to pick suitable default values to 
generate results that are representative of the 
actual transport.

Therefore, default values need to be chosen 
according to emission sensitive parameters, 
and ideally assumptions on which they are 
used should be specified in the reporting. In 
many cases, the use of measured primary data 
in combination with the use of secondary data 
is necessary.

Example:
The network contains all planned distances 
according to the TMS used. The fleet which is 
running on each origin/destination combination 
(TCE) is only roughly known: <40t trucks on 
collection and distribution trips, >40t trucks on 
linehaul trips.

In such a case, you can create two TOCs: one 
for the collection and distribution trips, and one 
for the linehaul trips. For each TOC, you need 
to indicate the share of primary data used. The 
remaining share of data may be either modeled 
based on primary data, or the industry average 
of the respective country and/or region may be 
taken as proxy. The process of extrapolation 
to 100% of vehicles operating in the network 
needs to be described in a transparent way and 
it needs to be audited.

As far as filling rates are concerned, the average 
filling rate in Europe for example is 60%, with 
an empty trip factor of 17% (see default data in 
Section 3 Module 2). Where you have access to 
primary data for filling rates for a certain share of 
the fleet, you may take these into account. 

Any deviation from the default filling rate (60% 
in Europe) and empty trip factor (17% in Europe) 
needs to be proven through measurement. For 
example, if all freight mass is weighed before 
pick up by a truck and the amount of trucks 
per size class operating for a certain transport 
activity is known, an average filling rate may be 
safely calculated based on this data.

Regarding truck size and pollution standard, if 
primary data is available for the majority of the 
fleet, e.g., 80%, then you can apply the GHG 

intensity data also to the remaining 20% of the 
fleet. If, however, vehicles from some TOCs are 
not represented in the primary data at all, or data 
is available for only a small share of vehicles for 
one specific TOC, GHG intensity for this TOC 
must be modeled with a bottom-up approach 
or using default data, as it cannot always be 
assumed that the small sample reflects the GHG 
intensity of the fleet of the entire TOC.

All emission sensitive parameters need to be 
modeled with care and transparency.

2. Calculation of GHG Emissions 
from Rail Transport

Rail transport can usually be calculated using 
the same logic as road transport, i.e., the TOCs 
follow emission sensitive parameters and 
are applied to the different TCEs. However, 
some rail-specific characteristics need to be 
considered:
• Most rail services are operated to a fixed  
  schedule. However, along the schedule the    
  train length may vary.
• Furthermore, train types vary significantly  
  according to their configuration: e.g., trains  
  designed to transport cars carry a certain  
  number of vehicles on their chassis, block  
  trains are composed of wagons of a certain    
  size, container trains carry crane-able road and  
  sea containers.
• The energy mix of rail transport may change   
  when a country border is crossed. Such a  
  change depends on the extent of electrification  
  in a particular country, and the specific grid    
  emission factor which depends on a country’s  
  electricity mix.

Therefore, TOCs need to be set up to reflect 
the different train types and energy sources, 
using mixes of primary, modeled and default 
data, as available.

The principles of calculating GHG emissions 
from rail freight are always similar, regardless 
of the propulsion system of the train or the 

geographical location. While rail carriers 
operating the train system can calculate 
emissions based on more detailed and usually 
primary data, shippers are often limited to 
using either data from the carrier or general 
rail transport default data. Shippers can use 
the following process when scrutinizing the 
data provided by their rail carrier.

3. Calculation of GHG Emissions 
from Air Transport

The key calculation aspects to take into account 
for air cargo transport are set out in Section 1, 
Chapter 4, on Modal Considerations.

To repeat in short:
• Activities in scope are all fuel use and other  
  GHG activities needed to operate the  
  aircraft, starting with taxiing, and to keep the   
  cargo in the required condition (including the   
  use of refrigerants for perishables and/or air-   
  conditioning).
• Emissions resulting from the handling of cargo 
  in an airport terminal or warehouse are 
   included in the calculation through the 
  definition and use of appropriate hub operation  
  categories (HOCs). The emission calculation 
  for the hub activity in a specific transport chain 
  requires the emission intensity of each of the 
  HOC to be applied to the throughput at each 
  hub in the transport chain.
• The allocation between passengers and freight 
  emissions are only mass based. Passenger  
  mass is actual passenger mass + the mass of  
  their accompanying baggage; if primary data is 
  not available a default mass of 100 kg is  
  applied. Cargo mass is the mass without  
  load carrier, according to the ISO 14083 
  provision of consignment mass and load 
  carrier definition.

• Where a TCE calculation is made bottom-up 
  based on an emission intensity using actual  
  distance flown, rather than the GCD of the  
  individual leg, then a Distance Adjustment  
  Factor (DAF) of 95 km needs to be applied as  
  part of the calculation.

3.1 Calculations based on primary data

Due to the strict logging of aircraft movements, 
primary data is always available for the air 
transport provider. Air carriers can therefore 
calculate their organizational carbon footprint by 
simply adding all flight emissions over a year.

For customers of aviation, the situation is very 
different. For a carbon footprint calculation 
Scope 3 (forwarders and shippers), the 
emissions are calculated for the trips (TCEs) 
booked by the customer. Such calculations 
should be based on a choice of TOC that 
enables customers to make reasonable 
decisions:

• If the customer wants to replace fossil 
kerosene by (SAF) on a certain route (airport 
pair), they need to receive emission data at a 
port pair granularity level, i.e., at least the fleet’s 
average emissions operating on this port pair 
during the summer and winter schedule.

For calculations in support of SAF replacing 
kerosene a direction and season agnostic 
aggregation level needs to be applied because 

an ISO 14083 compliant calculation needs to 
balance directional impacts: the emissions on 
the specific route, e.g., Frankfurt to New York, 
shall not depend on the direction (with or against 
the jet stream) and also not on the season 
when the flight actually takes place to enable a 
consistent customer promise.

It is also recommended to not separate out 
seasonal data i.e., don’t calculate summer vs. 
winter flight conditions separately.

•  If the customer has their own target with year-
on-year (YOY) carbon reduction budgets, they 
need to receive a robust, evened-out, emission 
report which reflects the route specifics and 
is sensitive to any operational or fleet related 
improvements the airline is undertaking, but 
not sensitive to any conditions which are 
neither under the control of the carrier nor of its 
transport patterns, such as weather conditions 
or temporary flight restrictions.

Note: It is a community decision whether a 
pandemic or a war situation is accounted for as 
“temporary” or not. If the industry risks missing 
its climate target on a mid-term or even long-
term scale, it is certainly not to be regarded as 
“temporary”.

The best aggregation level is always the fleet 
composition used on each service (port pair) 
over a period of the whole year.

The recommended maximum aggregated TOC 
to be applied is the aircraft type’s GHG activity 
in distance clusters, long-haul and short-haul, 
either split between passenger and freighter 
aircraft types or combined where this cannot 
be separated or is unknown. However, where 
combined the transport activity (RTK/tkm) ratio 
of two respective aircraft types need to be 
indicated, i.e., XX% of RTK in belly aircrafts and 
YY% in freighter aircrafts. If such information is 
not available, a well-based assumption needs to 
be taken and the assumptions should be made 
transparent in the reporting.

Example calculation
Considering one TOC composed of different 
aircraft types operating over one year, carrying 
both passengers and belly freight, the table 1 in 
Section 3 Module 2 gives an indicative example 
of the calculation of the transport activity of the 
TOC, expressed in passenger equivalents (peq).

The equivalence used is 100 kg per passenger 
and luggage, therefore, 1 tonne of freight equals 
10 peq. 

The assumptions for this example are: 400 
flights of 1000 km on average.

The percentage of the total transport activity 
gives the share of GHG emissions within the 
TOC between passengers and freight.

Assuming a reported primary fuel consumption of 7,000 kg of aviation fuel for the average 1,000 km flight within 
this TOC, then the calculation for a 275 kg consignment would be as follows:

Energy provision (WTT) TOC GHG emission intensity = 400 x 7,000 x 0.66 / 7,160,000 = 0.258 kg CO2e / tkm
Operational (TTW) TOC GHG emission intensity = 400 x 7,000 x 3.18 / 7,160,000 = 1.244 kg CO2e / tkm
Total (WTW) TOC GHG emission intensity = 400 x 7,000 x 3.84 / 7,160,000 = 1.502 kg CO2e / tkm

For the TCE calculation:

Transport activity = 0.275 x 1000 = 275 tkm

Energy provision (WTT) GHG emissions = 275 x 0.258 = 71.0 kg CO2e
Operational (TTW) GHG emissions = 275 x 1.244 = 342.1 kg CO2e
Total (WTW) GHG emissions = 275 x 1.502 = 413.1 kg CO2e

3.2 Advice for calculations based on 
secondary data

The use of default data should generally be 
avoided, particularly in aviation, where flights 
need to be logged in detail. For cases where 
such primary data is not available, default 
emission intensities are provided for a limited 
selection of air transport TOCs in Module 2. 

These values are based on specific assumptions 
which, while representative for typical industry 
conditions, may not bear much resemblance to 
the actual emission intensity of a particular flight 
because there is a lot of variability in the key 
influencing parameters. Deviations can easily be 
+/- 50% from the default value, such that for a 
default emission intensity of 800 g CO2e/tkm the 
actual value could be as low as 400 g/tkm or up 
to 1,200 g/tkm.

Unless air freight emissions only account for a 
very small part of a client’s (shipper’s) carbon 
footprint, it is recommended that in the absence 
of primary data the emissions are modeled using 
a bottom-up calculation (tool) including as a 
minimum:
•  scheduled route, including all transshipment   
  stops. (Note that technical stops do not need  
  to be included in the model. While they add    
  fuel consumption, they enable carrying of less  
  fuel on the aircraft, which by and large evens   
  out the effect.)
• scheduled fleet composition (which includes 
  possible deviation from the actual aircraft 
  operation for certain slots) over the schedule 
  periods on all routes

126

Module 4 
Examples of 
emission calculations 
- step-by-step

• modeled fuel consumption of all respective    
  aircraft types involved, i.e., engine-type  
  related fuel consumption (with transparent  
  use of manufacturer data or evaluation of an 
   extensive set of primary data, including any 
  such calculations)
• industry average load per aircraft type (with 
  all passenger and freighter aircraft averages 
  separated as a minimum) during a scheduled 
  period, and calculation with evened out 
  emissions over one year.

Additional, desirable parameters include:
• aircraft type’s seat and belly capacity  
  configuration and related load capacity
• knowledge of aircraft type’s actual operation,  
  i.e., where is it actually flying (which may  
  deviate from schedule)

NOTE: It is imperative that all GHG activity 
related parameters, such as aircraft types and 
their load factor, fuel consumption related 
thereto, route specifics etc., are modeled and 
aggregated in a direction and season agnostic 
way, i.e., evened out in both route directions and 
over the summer and winter schedule in order 
to avoid differences in calculation outputs for 
different clients and Scope 3 reporting entities 
for the same port pair operated by the same 
fleet composition at different times of the year or 
in different directions (FRA–NYC vs. NYC–FRA).

3.3 Calculation of GHG activities other 
than fuel use

Apart from fuel consumption, other GHG 
activities such as the use of refrigerants need to 
be taken into account:
• With primary data, the carrier needs to add    
  the average emissions due to the aircraft’s  
  air-conditioning to the emission intensity per  
  tonne-km. Where there is a significant  
  difference between the use of refrigerants in 
  passenger vs. freighter aircraft, or in different 
  distance classes etc., such emissions need 
  to be allocated within the relevant TOC, i.e., 
  proportionately to their end use.
• With modeling, industry average values for  
  specific input parameters may be applied 
  when primary data values are missing,  
  accompanied by an indication of the respective  
  source and literature. It must be applied as an  
  additional GHG per tkm or per kg of freight and  
  indicated as a separate value.
• With temperature-controlled cargo, e.g.,  
  perishables such as fresh fish, flowers etc., 
  the applied refrigerants need to be tracked 
  separately and their emissions allocated to the 
  respective cargo. 

NOTE: With additional cargo related accessories 
such as ice bags or similar, these accessories 
need to be accounted for separately in terms 
of additional cargo weight (which increases fuel 
consumption and fuel related emissions): e.g. 
1 tonne of fresh fish which requires an ice bed 
of 500 kg, the total weight would be 1.5 tonnes. 
In addition, the amount of energy used for the 
temperature control of the ice bed needs to be 
accounted for.

4. Calculation of GHG Emissions 
from Sea Transport

As sea shipping can be conducted on different 
vessel types (bulk ships, container vessels, 
RoRo and RoPax ferries, ferries and others), the 
methodology, especially the allocation to the 
different cargo types, may vary. It is therefore 
important to apply the methodology specified 
for the respective type of service.

4.1 Container Transport

One major type, especially in global shipping, 
is ocean container vessels. The related 
methodology has been developed and revised 
over many years by Clean Cargo (see also 
Chapter 2.3) which represents 85% of the 
world’s container shipping.

For non-Clean Cargo members trade lane-
specific carbon intensities are provided, 
averaged over all reporting carriers, on an annual 
basis (see Section 3, Module 2). The user needs 
to take into account that the emission intensities 
are based on a 70% industry average load 
factor and a mix of services on the respective 
trade lane which contain a different number of 
port calls. These values may be applied for any 
port-to-port journey. The end user factors for 
containerized shipping are calculated according 
to the stages presented in the Clean Cargo 
methodology24 which is currently elevated to a 
higher granularity level of TOCs.

Currently, three levels of information (TOC 
aggregation) are available, depending on the 
level of information about origin and destination 
known to the user (see tables 16 and 17 in 
Section 3 Module 2):
• The overall Clean Cargo industry average
• Five sets of aggregated data for major trade 
lane groupings (see figure below) based on a 
weighted average of flows on the detailed trade 
lanes included within each grouping.
• The full set of Clean Cargo trade lanes
These factors may result in less granular 
calculations than a sophisticated tool. However, 
as the method is widely accepted and further 
developed in the Clean Cargo community, it is 
recommended to apply these factors to enable 
consistent calculation over different actors in the 
transport chain.

Where a service purchaser (forwarder, shipper) 
does not apply the available TOC intensity 
factors, they may apply an SFC accredited 
emission calculation tool.

The original emission intensities are based on 
actual distances, meaning that users would 
need to apply a DAF of 15% to compensate 
for the difference between actual and shortest 
feasible distance. However, the end user factors 
shown in tables 16 and 17 of Section 3, Module 
2 have been adjusted for this already, so that the 
user can apply the planned distance directly. 

127

 
 
 
 
Example:
A shipper transports 10 container twenty-foot 
equivalent units (TEUs) from Hamburg to 
Shanghai. It may apply the end user emission 
intensity value for the Asia to-from North-
Europe trade lane, which reads 44.1 g CO2e/
TEU-km. A sea-routing tool may tell them that 
the port-to-port distance would be 21,000 km. 
The total emission for these 10 TEUs would be:

10 TEUs x 21,000 km x 44.1 g CO2e/TEU-km 
= 9.26 tonnes CO2e.

Where 5 of the 10 TEUs are reefer containers, 
the emission intensity for reefer transport on 
this trade lane, which is 114.8 g CO2e/TEU-km, 
needs to be applied, resulting in 5 TEU x 21,000 
km x 114.8 g/TEU-km = 12.05 tonnes CO2e for 
these 5 containers.

4.2 Use of primary data

Clean Cargo provides GHG emission intensities 
based on primary data at different TOC 
granularity levels, depending on membership 
status. The highest aggregation is trade lane 
specific across all carriers in Clean Cargo. Such 
annually published data is designed for use by 
companies that need to calculate and report 
Scope 3 sea container transport emissions. 

The challenges for a carrier in calculating its 
emission intensity from primary data inputs are:
• the distance between the loading and 
   discharge ports within a loop (service), i.e.,  
  TCE based;
• the actual container load per TCE (excluding   
  empty containers);

• the identification of a relevant TOC and its  
  characteristics;
• the total transport activity for the TOC,  
  quantified in TEU-km;
• the share of reefer containers loaded (i.e.,  
  capacity use of reefer slots between two ports)  
  for the TOC;
• the actual fuel consumption of each type of    
  fuel for the TOC;
• the energy consumption of the auxiliary  
  engines for the TOC;
• the energy consumption of shore power  
  while at berth in each port – which should be  
  converted to GHG emissions and added to the  
  emission total of the TOC;
• the refrigerant use for each vessel associated  
  with the TOC.

Emission intensities need to be created per 
TEU-km and, alongside, per tkm (calculated 
using either actual TEU filling rates or a standard 
conversion of 10 tonnes per TEU). Alternatively, 
a value of 6 tonnes may be used for lightweight 
cargo or 14.5 tonnes for heavyweight cargo, if 
the use of these categories can be justified.

Useful aggregation levels may be derived from 
such data. These are all available to a carrier, but 
should not be combined in the same system:
• All port pair emissions, including the emissions 
  while staying in the port, may be aggregated   
  over a vessel’s complete round trip with  
  emission intensities in g/TEU-km and g/tkm, 
   which apply to all port pairs within such a 
  round trip, derived from it.
• Several vessels’ emissions could be 
  aggregated at an aggregated service level if 
  the vessels in the service do not vary too much  
  in engine design (fuel types) and size class.

Whatever the case, a carrier should deliver TOC 
and TCE based primary data which are fully ISO 
14083 compliant.

4.3 Use of secondary (modeled) data

There are numerous tools which model ocean 
shipping data to a wide range of granularities, 
from tracking vessels via GPS, with detailed 
knowledge on engine power, filling rates by 
the measured draught and even fuel type 
compositions, through to calculators applying 
average parameters for distances, vessel size 
and filling rates, fuel type compositions, etc. The 
calculations produced by different tools with 
different granularity levels need to be examined 
in detail to secure comparability.

Any modeling needs to be conducted using a 
set of TOCs that follow the principles of ISO 
14083. Distances used to calculate the TOC’s 
emission intensity should use SFD, or where 
not available the TCE transport activity must be 
adjusted using an appropriate DAF. Any empty 
running also needs to be included within the 
TOC calculation. Although tempting, the use 
of the most granular modeling approaches 
can easily breach these conditions. As such 
the Scope 3 calculation would exclude a share 
of detours due to weather conditions, port 
congestion etc. which would breach the core 
principles of ISO 14083. (It is important to arrive 
at realistic emissions which the Scope 3 emitter 
needs to account for, especially given the 
carbon price tag and high investments needed 
to replace fossil marine fuels by non-fossil 
alternatives.)

4.4 Bulk Sea Transport

Bulk shipping, particularly in the form of 
short-term time charters, is one of the limited 
exceptions identified in ISO 14083 where a 
round trip logic to the TOC definition is not 
compulsory. Even here it is important to include 
any associated empty running into consideration 
as part of the TOC definition, so the emissions 
associated with a preceding ballast leg, if there 
is one, need to be included. (One option to help 
reduce emissions from shipping charters is to 
avoid chartering vessels that require a ballast leg 
to fulfil the contract.)

Example:
The following example focuses on the following 
fictitious scenario.

A shipping company charters a bulk vessel 
for a voyage from Asia to South America and 
subcharters space on the vessel out to two 
customers to transport freight from different 
locations in South America to Asia.

In this case the charterer agrees with its 
customers that the TOC is defined by the single 
trip. The transport chain consists of the following 
elements (see Table 9):

The TOC is defined as the sum of TCEs 1, 3, 5 
and 7 and the emissions and intensity should be 
calculated for the TOC and applied to each of 
the TCEs. The emissions associated with each 
hub from the loading and unloading activity 
would be calculated according to the HOC 
associated with each of the hubs.

In this fictitious example the charterer has 
access to primary data for the transport TCEs 
but has to rely on default data for the hub TCEs 
as the hub operators do not yet calculate and 
report their emissions.

Developing the TOC Calculation

The operational characteristics known to the 
charterer are shown in Table 10. Cargo owner A’s 
cargo is loaded first at location B and remains 
onboard until location D. Cargo owner B’s 
cargo is then loaded at location C and remains 
onboard until location E.

The TOC emissions are based on the total of each fuel used, as follows:

Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO)> 
Energy production GHG emissions: 1327.48 × 1000 × 0.68 = 902,686 kg CO2e
Operational GHG emissions: 1327.48 × 1000 × 3.16 = 4,194,837 kg CO2e
Total GHG emissions: 1327.48 × 1000 × 3.84 = 5,097,523 kg CO2e

Marine Gas Oil (MGO)
Energy production GHG emissions: 19.88 × 1000 × 0.61 = 12,127 kg CO2e
Operational GHG emissions: 19.88 × 1000 × 3.26 = 64,809 kg CO2e
Total GHG emissions: 19.88 × 1000 × 3.87 = 76,936 kg CO2e

Emission factors for VLSFO and MGO taken from Module 1 for North America.

Total TOC energy production GHG emissions: 902,686 + 12,127 = 914,813 kg CO2e
Total TOC operational GHG emissions: 4,194,837 + 64,809 = 4,259,646 kg CO2e
Total TOC GHG emissions: 5,097,523 + 76,936 = 5,174,459 kg CO2e

GHG emission intensity = total GHG emissions divided by the total transport activity.

TOC overall GHG emission intensity: 5,174,459 / 755,830,574 = 0.00685 kg CO2e / tkm

HOC Characteristics

Because the charterer has to rely on default data for the hub operations, and the hubs are all 
considered to be generic bulk terminals, they use a default value of 1.3 kg CO2e / t.

Calculation for the Whole Transport Chain for Cargo Owner A

The calculation applies for the TCE’s where Cargo Owner A’s cargo was transported 
(TCEs 3 and 5) or handled (i.e. loaded TCE 2 and unloaded TCE 6).

NOTE: GHG emissions are zero for TCE 1, the ballast leg, because the actual emissions for 
this leg are reallocated to the transport activity across the rest of the transport chain.

The total GHG emissions for the transport chain of Cargo Owner A is the sum of the GHG 
emissions for each TCE, i.e.,

Total TCE energy production GHG emissions: 633,839 kg CO2e
Total TCE operational GHG emissions: 3,053,707 kg CO2e
Total TCE GHG emissions: 3,687,546 kg CO2e

The overall GHG emission intensity for the transport chain of Cargo Owner A is calculated as 
the total GHG emissions divided by the total transport activity: 
3,687,546 / 523,686,438 = 0.00704 kg CO2e / tkm.

4.5 RoPax Ferry Transport

Using the calculated share of GHG emissions the breakdown of the freight component is as follows:

Unaccompanied Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) trailers:
Energy production GHG emissions: 0.044 x 2,720,000 = 119,256 kg CO2e
Operational GHG emissions: 0.044 × 12,640,000 = 554,191 kg CO2e
Total GHG emissions: 0.044 × 15,360,000 = 673,447 kg CO2e

HGVs:
Energy production GHG emissions: 0.479 x 2,720,000 = 1,303,300 kg CO2e
Operational GHG emissions: 0.479 × 12,640,000 = 6,056,512 kg CO2e
Total GHG emissions: 0.479 × 15,360,000 = 7,359,812 kg CO2e

Taking the average mass of a typical HGV to be 29.6t, comprising 14t for the unladen vehicle and 
15.6 for the load then the GHG emission intensities for both the overall laden HGV and the load 
within would be as follows:

GHG emission intensities for the overall laden HGV:
Energy production GHG emission intensity: 1,303,300 / (34,000 x 120 x 29.6) = 0.0108 kg CO2e/tkm
Operational GHG emission intensity: 6,056,512 / (34,000 x 120 x 29.6) = 0.0502 kg CO2e/tkm
Total GHG emission intensity: 7,359,812 / (34,000 x 120 x 29.6) = 0.0610 kg CO2e/tkm

GHG emission intensities for the cargo with the HGVs:
Energy production GHG emission intensity: 1,303,300 / (34,000 x 120 x 15.6) = 0.0205kg CO2e/tkm
Operational GHG emission intensity: 6,056,512 / (34,000 x 120 x 15.6) = 0.0952 kg CO2e/tkm
Total GHG emission intensity: 7,359,812 / (34,000 x 120 x 15.6) = 0.1156 kg CO2e/tkm

The operator of a RoPax ferry line wishes to calculate and report the freight transport component 
of its GHG emissions from its ferry operations over a period of time.

Example:
During the period in question the ferry line uses 4000 t of VLSFO on a regular route with 
transport distance of 120km.

Energy production emissions: 4000 × 1000 × 0.68 = 2,720,000 kg CO2e
Operational emissions: 4000 × 1000 × 3.16 = 12,640,000 kg CO2e
Total emissions: 4000 × 1000 × 3.84 = 15,360,000 kg CO2e

Emission factors for VLSFO taken from Module 1 for North America.

The observed usage data of the ferry was as shown in table 12.

5. Calculation of GHG Emissions 
from Hub Operations

Hub operations usually occur where freight 
is transferred from one vehicle or mode of 
transport to another before, between, or 
after elements of a transport chain. The total 
GHG emissions of a HOC are the sum of the 
emissions of the hub equipment operations 
(TTW or HEO) and the related hub equipment 
energy provision (WTT or HEEP) of the HOC. 

The following calculation examples start from 
the basic use case, and we assume that access 
is given to relevant GHG activity data (electricity 
use, fuel consumption etc.), so that the average 
emission intensity value can be calculated. 
In our example we calculate two different 
scenarios:
• HOC with one hub and one average emission 
intensity value
• HOC with one hub and two emission 
intensity values

(We are aware that it is not always possible 
to access all relevant primary data. If no GHG 
emission intensities can be calculated, we 
recommend using the default values for logistics 
hubs (see Module 2) to get an approximation of 
the emissions for the hub operations.)

For simplification, only the multiplication of 
GHG activity data and the total GHG emission 
factor is shown in this example. However, for 
further disaggregation the specific emissions 
factors for HOC (TTW) and HEEP (WTT) can also 
be used.

Table 13 gives you an overview of the emission 
factors we used for our example.

5.1 Freight transport hub - HOC with one hub 
and one average emission intensity value

This example refers to a container terminal in 
Germany, at which dry and reefer containers 
are handled. Only the total annual hub activity is 
known (4,250,000 t). Therefore, it is possible to 
derive one average emission factor.

First the total GHG emissions caused by 
container handling, general processes and 
the reefer station are calculated. Then the 
calculation of an average GHG emission 
intensity value for the hub operations.

When dividing the total GHG emissions of the 
HOC by the total annual hub activity, the result is 
an average GHG emission intensity value for the 
hub operations.

Average GHG emission intensity value:
991,519 kg CO2e / 4,250,000 t = 0.23 CO2e/t

Due to the lack of data in finer granularity, a 
further breakdown of the hub activity is not 
possible. Therefore, in such a case of average 
emission intensity values, emissions of the 
ambient freight are somewhat overestimated, 
and emissions of refrigerated freight are 
underestimated. In such a case, it is advisable to 
collect further data at finer granularity to support 
a more differentiated analysis of the GHG 

emissions by the different hub 
operation activities

Nonetheless, this HOC GHG emission intensity 
factor can be provided to supply chain 
customers to apply to their own transport 
chains as it an approximate value based on 
the available primary data.

5.2 Freight transport hub - HOC with one hub 
and two emission intensity values

The second scenario refers again to the same 
container terminal in Germany, but now the 
difference is that more detailed data on the 
annual hub activities is available. The container 
terminal handles dry (4,200,000 t) and reefer 
(50,000 t) containers. 

Two emission intensity values can be identified 
in this situation: one for the hub operations of 
ambient freight and one for hub operations of 
refrigerated freight. Therefore, a distinction is 
made between processes that are relevant to all 

types of freight (handing containers and 
general processes summarized as GHG 
emissions “unspecified group”) and those that 
are only necessary for refrigerated freight (reefer 
station summarized as GHG emissions for 
“refrigerated freight”) or that are only necessary 
for ambient freight.

For simplification, only the multiplication of 
GHG activity data and the total GHG emission 
factor is shown in this example. Nevertheless, 
for further disaggregation the specific emissions 
factors for HEO (TTW) and HEEP (WTT) can 
also be used.

The emissions resulting from handling 
containers and general processes applicable to 
both groups of freight, ambient and refrigerated 
freight (GHG emissions “general”) can be 
calculated as follows:

GHG emission intensity value for 
refrigerated freight:
0.218 kg CO2e/t + 1.32 kg CO2e/t = 
1.54 kg CO2e/t

Again, these HOC GHG emission intensity 
values can be provided to supply chain 
customers to apply to their own transport 
chains or TCEs respectively. For example, 
to calculate a client-specific transfer of 
containerized dry goods freight (87 tonnes), the 
amount of freight must be multiplied by the GHG 
intensity value for ambient freight.

Client specific calculation for ambient freight:
87 t * 0.218 kg CO2e/t = 19.0 kg CO2e

In the same way, the emissions can be 
calculated for 100 tonnes of refrigerated freight 
using the corresponding GHG emissions 
intensity value for refrigerated freight:

Client specific calculation for refrigerated freight:
100 t * 1.54 kg CO2e/t = 154 kg CO2e

GHG emission intensity “general”:
925,519 kg CO2e / 4,250,000 t = 
0.218 kg CO2e/t

The emissions of the reefer station (GHG 
emissions “refrigerated freight”) are only 
associated with the hub operation activity of 
50,000 t refrigerated weight and can therefore 
be calculated as follows:

GHG emission intensity “refrigerated freight”:
66,000 kg CO2e / 50,000 t = 1.32 kg CO2e/t

Now the corresponding emission intensity 
values for handling of ambient freight and 
handling of refrigerated freight can be derived. 
As no specific, additional operations have been 
carried out for the ambient freight, the GHG 
emission intensity value is equal to the GHG 
emission intensity “general”.

GHG emission intensity value for ambient freight:
0.218 kg CO2e/t

For refrigerated freight the GHG emission 
intensity value is the sum of the GHG emission 
intensity for “general” plus the GHG emission 
intensity for “refrigerated freight”.

Calculating GHG transport 
and logistics emissions for the 
European Chemical Industry

1. Introduction

The members of Cefic, representing the majority of the 
chemical industry in Europe, recognize the importance 
of reducing the overall environmental impact of freight 
transport.  Hence, knowledge about the GHG emissions that 
result from the transport of goods within their supply chain, 
both inbound to their production plants and outbound to their 
customers, is important to them. These guidelines support 
them in gaining this knowledge, so enabling them to take 
steps to reduce their impact.

Cefic and European Chemical Transport 
Association (ECTA), representing the 
specialist transport companies who work 
on behalf of the chemical producers, 
published a first guideline for the 
calculation of tank to wheel GHG emissions 
from freight transport operations applicable 
to the European chemical sector in March 
2011. Since then there have been many 
developments in the field of GHG emission 
accounting, both in general and specifically 
for freight transport operations, including 
the EN16258 standard published in 2012, 
the GLEC Framework first published in 
2016 and ISO 14083 published in 2023. 
A particular change worth noting is that 
the well-to-tank (WTT) emission factors 
of most fossil fuels have increased 
significantly since the September 2021 
version of this guide. More information on 

this can be found in Module 1 of the GLEC 
Framework.

Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the 
process remain the same:

• Establish the amount and type of fuel  
  used for the transport service in question
• Convert the fuel use to a well-to-wheel  
  (WTW) GHG emission value, expressed  
  as mass of CO2e
• Relate the GHG emissions, including  
  those from cleaning and warehousing,  
  to the transport and logistics activity,  
  expressed in tonne-kilometers, provided  
  by the service
• Report both the total GHG emissions and 
   the emission intensity, expressed as  
  mass of CO2e per tonne km

Calculating GHG transport 
and logistics emissions for the 
European Chemical Industry

This process is set out in more detail Section 1, 
Chapters 1-4 of the GLEC Framework.

This updated report reflects changes that have 
occurred in the past 12 years and represents 
an opportunity for the sector to respond to 
increasing pressure from investors, legislation 
and customers to reduce GHG emissions from 
freight transport activities in particular, given 
its classification as a “hard to abate” sector.  
Implementing this guidance will show that 
the sector is adopting current best practice, 
adapted specifically for the chemical industry, 
and is preparing itself for the decarbonization 
challenge that will become increasingly 
apparent in the coming years.

The scope of the GHG emission calculation 
covered in this report includes the transport 
and logistics activities directly related to the 
chemical industry supply chain.  The primary 
focus is the transport and logistics operations 
the companies are contractually responsible 
for, which are primarily the transport of finished 
goods to their customers.  Estimates may 
also be made for transport operations within 
the supply chain that are the responsibility of 
other entities, for example inbound transport 
of raw materials, although any such estimates 
will inevitably be subject to greater uncertainty 
due to lack of knowledge of all parameters 
and hence greater reliance on estimation 
and assumptions.  Therefore, it is highly 
recommended to request transport emission 
data to be included in the emission reporting of 
the contracting party.

The activities include:
• The transport itself, including associated  
  vehicle repositioning needed to fulfil
  the service
•  The handling of goods and short-term  
  storage at logistics sites, including energy use  
  associated with movement of goods within a  
  logistics site or warehouse and the operation  
  of the storage or handling facility
• Tank cleaning operations required to make    
  vehicles available for their use in chemical    
  transport
• Temperature control (whether heating or 
   cooling) required for conditioning of the 
  product during the transport chain

Items specifically excluded are:
• Activities associated with intermediate  
  processing of a product, including where its  
  nature is fundamentally changed
•  Administrative functions of the transport  
  company, even if they are co-located at a  
  logistics site
• Maintenance of site or vehicles
•  Vehicle or transport infrastructure

The report is structured as follows:

•  Section 2 sets out some of the specific  
  characteristics of chemical industry logistics  
  operations that influence the way that  
  GHG emissions are calculated as well as the  
  resulting impacts.
• Section 3 sets out typical or representative 
   values that may be used as default values by  
  European chemical companies in cases  
  where they are beginning to compute GHG   
  emissions or where more specific carrier data  
  is not available, for whatever reason.

•  Section 4 provides guidance for carriers  
  and logistics service providers (LSPs) when it  
  comes to interpreting these guidelines.
•  Section 5 provides guidance for chemical  
  companies when it comes to implementing   
  the GLEC Framework and the influence of    
  these industry-specific guidelines.
•  Section 6 acknowledges that knowledge  
  about GHG emission impacts and
  calculations is continually evolving, as is  
  the list of potential low emission solutions 
  that are available to companies, including 
  those in the chemical industry. This section 
  also indicates areas where updates are 
   most likely to be needed in the relatively  
  near future and where this would be reflected 
  in future versions of this guidance.
•  A summary table of the default GHG  
  emission intensities for road transport based  
  on knowledge of load and empty running is   
  presented in Annex 1, while Annex 2 presents  
  additional information about intermodal  
  transport.

2. Chemical industry specifics

This section describes specific characteristics 
of chemical industry transport and logistics 
operations that are not set out in detail in the 
existing GLEC Framework. The approach 
in terms of core methodology is unaffected, 
i.e., identify all the individual elements of the 
transport chain, including any associated 
empty running, and then collect the information 
necessary to calculate the emissions.

However, some of these characteristics do 
influence the way in which transport operation 
categories (TOCs) are defined for use in 

chemical transport operations.  The result is 
a more detailed and specific set of transport 
categories than the general set defined in the 
main body of the GLEC Framework.

2.1 Nature of the cargo transported

The cargo transported for the chemical industry 
is a mixture of solids, liquids and gases that are 
either ingredients for or the result of chemical 
processes managed by the chemical industry.  
Consignment sizes tend to be greater than in 
the wider transport sector, which leads to a 
greater incidence of bulk transportation, the 
potential for higher payloads, especially when 
expressed in terms of cargo mass, and a 
greater potential for use of intermodal solutions 
and high-capacity modes such as rail, inland 
waterway and sea transport.

Some cargos have very specific storage or 
handling requirements that impact upon the 
way that transport chains in the chemical 
industry are arranged.  This may also impact on 
the nature of the equipment used and on the 
business relationship, e.g., greater reliance on 
tankers or equipment that can withstand high 
pressures.  These issues are reflected in some 
of the following subsections.

Analysis of data collected by ECTA suggested 
that the nature of the cargo, when classified as 
dry bulk, liquid bulk or cargo packed in smaller 
containers, does have an impact on both 
average load and the extent of empty running.  
This has been combined with information 
collected from chemical companies (Cefic 
members) to compile the input parameters 
used to define the default values presented in 
section 3 of this report.

2.2 Shared transport – definitions and use

Terminology can vary within the freight 
transport sector as a whole and even within a 
segment such as chemical transportation.  The 
following terms have been used to establish the 
chemical sector default emission intensities:

•  Full truckload (FTL): a chemical company  
  has enough product for a consignment to fill  
  a vehicle, by weight or other dimension, close  
  to the vehicle’s legal limits and that vehicle    
  travels from a single point of origin to a single  
  destination to deliver the single consignment.
•  Less than truckload (LTL): a chemical  
  company has one or more consignments  
  that individually are not big enough to fill a  
  vehicle, by weight or other dimension, to the 
  vehicle’s legal limits.  An approximate  
  boundary of 15 tonnes, i.e. ± 60% load by    
  mass, has been used to differentiate full and  
  less than truckload.  LTL transport can be split  
  into many different subcategories with widely  
  differing characteristics.  For the purposes    
  of this document the following two categories  
  have been used:
•  Partial load: a single LTL consignment, which  
  on its own is not big enough to fill a vehicle,  
  by weight or other dimension, is transported  
  on its own from a single point of origin to a 
  single destination. The reason can be 
   timing (rush order) or incompatibility with  
  other products.
•  Groupage: multiple LTL consignments,  
  potentially originating from different  
  chemical companies and different origins 
  are consolidated by an LSP to achieve a main 
  haul transport with higher  load factor than 
  would otherwise be the case. The   

  consolidated consignments may be delivered 
  to one or several end destinations.  
  Consignment size, operating pattern, overall 
  load factor can all vary considerably within 
  this broad category of transport.

The use of groupage transport is 
commonplace, particularly for packed goods.  
The nature of the cargo may require specialist 
transport providers who are used to handling, 
or even licensed to handle, cargos with specific 
properties.  The benefit of groupage services 
from a GHG emission perspective is that the 
transport provider should be able to achieve 
greater overall efficiency by carrying several 
consignments from different providers in one 
trip, so maximizing load factors and minimizing 
empty running.  Sharing of operational 
information and actual GHG emission 
performance of groupage transport has been 
relatively uncommon; however, with the 
increased focus on transparency and reduction 
of GHG emissions we expect that may change 
in the future.  The work required of the transport 
company should not be any greater than for 
dedicated transport, because all customers 
would be expected to share a network average 
emission intensity that reflects the overall 
benefit of the shared transport operation and 
the associated improved efficiency.

2.3 Dedicated transport

The use of dedicated transport services, 
where dedicated equipment is provided by the 
transport company for the use of a specific 
product (and company), is more common in 
the chemical sector than in general haulage, 
particularly due to the specialist nature of the 

equipment, cargos and cleaning requirements.  
This could lead to an increased incidence of 
empty running.  Hence there is a trade-off 
between dedicated transport contracts and a 
lower overall system efficiency with higher GHG 
emissions.

This places a responsibility on chemical 
companies and their transport providers to 
investigate options to reduce the incidence 
of company-specific dedicated transport 
wherever the business model will allow it.  For 
example, allowing transport of compatible 
loads or using cleaning facilities close to the 
point of unloading that would allow a backload 
would both avoid an empty return trip to base 
and improve overall transport system efficiency.

Data collected by ECTA suggested that 
there are significant variations reported in 
terms of average load and particularly empty 
running from transport operator to transport 
operator.  Unfortunately, it has not been 
possible to isolate the nature of the transport 
operation to establish whether dedicated 
transport contracts were contributing to this 
variation.  The assumption is that dedicated 
transport would result in higher level of empty 
running than for shared transport.  However, 
it is likely that there is also a variation in the 
operating practices between differing transport 
companies which is a clear reason to advocate 
for the use of primary data as the basis for 
GHG calculations.

139

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4 Payloads

As mentioned previously, the cargo tends to be 
relatively dense and consignments are larger, 
leading to payloads that are typically much 
closer to vehicle payload limits than the overall 
sector average.  Nonetheless, consultation 
with individual chemical companies did 
reveal significant variations from company to 
company, around a relatively high average 
payload figure.

Although high payload does slightly increase 
vehicle fuel consumption and emissions when 
expressed on a per vehicle kilometer basis, the 
benefit of transporting more cargo in a single 
trip significantly outweighs this effect and leads 
to a much lower emission intensity, expressed 
in emissions per unit of transport activity (mass 
CO2e / tonne km).

The variation from company to company 
emphasizes the importance of using primary 
data for the calculation of emissions at a 
company or even better at product level, and of 
monitoring factors such as the load factor and 
extent of empty running within a supply chain

1. To adhere to the basic principle of accuracy
2. To help identify where efficiency 
improvements and hence emission reductions 
can be achieved

It is through simple steps like these that 
short-term emission reductions can be easily 
achieved at relatively low cost and to the 
benefit of all parties involved and wider society.

The typical payloads used in generating the 
road transport default GHG emission intensities 
for chemical transport are as follows:

2.5 Empty running 

Table 2
Typical empty running values used in generating default emission intensities

Minimizing the extent of empty running is a way 
for all parties with an interest in freight transport 
to improve efficiency.  At the same time a 
certain level of empty running is inevitable, 
especially for FTL transport, as it is unlikely that 
the next consignment will always be available 
at the point of unloading the previous one.  
Groupage allows an LSP to minimize empty 
running within the constraints of their network 
and the amount of business they are able to 
generate. The extent of empty running is an 
important influencing factor on GHG emission 
intensities. The values in Table 2 have been 
used in this document. 

It is through simple steps like these that 
short-term emission reductions can be easily 
achieved at relatively low cost and to the 
benefit of all parties involved and wider society.

The typical payloads used in generating the 
road transport default GHG emission intensities 
for chemical transport are show in Table 1. 

Higher values of empty running have been 
assumed for dedicated transport services 
based on discussions with Cefic members 
that are within the range reported in the ECTA 
survey. 

2.6 Cleaning operations 

In many cases the purity of the cargo is 
important to meet strict product standards.  
Where such a restriction applies it is essential 
that the transport equipment is thoroughly 
cleaned between the successive transport

operations conducted by a vehicle to avoid 
cross contamination.  The required cleaning 
operations are carried out to industry standards 
at facilities that may or may not be present 
at, or close to, the location where a particular 
cargo is unloaded or the next cargo is to 
be loaded.  If no cleaning station is present 
the result may be additional empty running 
between point of unloading and the next 
loaded journey.  In extreme cases, if a cleaning 
facility is not available in the locality of the 
unloading location, this may necessitate a 
return to base for cleaning before the next 
journey can be undertaken. 

The impact of cleaning on empty running has 
been factored into the default values based 
on feedback and data received from Cefic and 
ECTA members. 

Where a cleaning operation is known to 
take place the calculation of transport GHG 
emissions should be based on a combination 
of the transport emissions and the GHG 
emissions associated with a cleaning operation.  
A default value for the GHG emissions from 
cleaning is provided in section 3.10.  However, 
that value depends heavily on the local 
electricity emission factor and the efficiency 
and energy source of the steam generator.  This 

information may support emission reduction 
through re-evaluating options for compatible 
loads, potentially moving away from dedicated 
company transport. 

Because the choice of cleaning versus 
dedicated transport is part of the operational 
model of the transport provider, and may 
change depending on volumes and business 
developments, it is important for the chemical 
company to ensure the service provider 
considers this option.  Given high the variability 
of cleaning emissions it is recommended that 
the provider of the cleaning operations uses 
a specific value for the GHG emission per 
cleaning operation for their specific situation, 
wherever possible.  Further guidance can be 
found at: https://www.eftco.org/safe-cleaning/
emission-guideline. 

2.7 Tank container transport 

From a GHG calculation methodology 
perspective, the use of tank containers to 
transport fluids is not per se a significant 
deviation from other truck body types, i.e., the 
standard trailer used in generic road transport 
calculations.  What is important to note is that, 
as for all other transport, it is the net weight of 
the load that should be used when calculating 
the transport activity, i.e. excluding the weight 
of the container.  If there is any uncertainty, 
please confirm with the carrier that the weight 
of the container has not been included in the 
calculation of the GHG emission intensity.

2.8 Pipeline transport 

Pipeline transport is a form of transport that 
is highly specific to the chemical sector and 
is not currently reflected in the main body of 
the GLEC Framework, except in passing in the 
introduction.  Hence, information for pipeline 
transport has been developed specifically for 
this report.  This has highlighted that, although 
information is known to pipeline operators, until 
now sharing and calculation of GHG emissions 
from this transport mode has been limited. 

Discussion among the project group suggested 
that there are several factors that influence 
the emission intensity of pipeline transport, 
including: 

• Pipeline length 
• Pipeline diameter 
• Nature of the product (liquid or gas) 
• Viscosity of the product 
• Pressure within the pipeline system, which 
   may be varied depending on required  
  flow rate 

Some products, particularly gases, may 
come out of the production plant in a highly 
pressurized form.  If that pressure can be 
captured then the product may, in some cases, 
flow due to the original pressurization without 
requiring extra energy for transportation.  In 
order to ensure consistency with the overall 
project scope, and boundaries used for the 
emissions for production plants and logistics 
sites, the following boundaries were agreed: 

• Do not include the energy used by pumps    
  “within the boundaries of a production site”   
  meaning that only the energy used by pumps  
  when the product is in transit contribute to the  
  pipeline transport emissions 

• If the product is already in transit, and  
  being transferred from a ship or barge, any 
  pumps on board the ship or barge would be 
  accounted for by the ship, whereas any pumps  
  linked to the pipeline would be included in the 
  pipeline emissions

This is shown in figure 1.

Given the potential variability of pipeline 
emission intensity it is recommended that 
chemical companies request emission 
intensity data from the operator of the pipeline 
expressed in GHG emissions per tonne km of 
product throughput, averaged on an annual 
basis in order to calculate representative 
emissions in a comparable way to other 
transport modes.

3. Impact of chemical industry 
specifics on default values

3.1 Sector-specific TOCs

This section presents the result of the 
discussions within the project group on how 
the individual different TOCs should be set out 
on a mode-by-mode basis and the resulting 
default GHG emission intensities. 

Similar to the presentation of default values 
in the main body of the GLEC Framework, 
defaults are presented in a hierarchy of three 
levels, starting from a highly generic situation 
where the chemical company knows little 
about the consignment or how it is transported, 
through a situation of partial knowledge 
through to a more detailed knowledge of the 
goods and the detailed means of transport.  
Through this progression the assumptions 
become more specific to the transport in 
question and the values more representative of 
the actual transport. 

All emission intensities are presented as WTW 
values in g CO2e/tkm.

3.2 Road transport 

Following the approach taken in Module 2 
of the main GLEC Framework three levels of 
default GHG emission intensity are provided for 
road transport: 

Level 1: to be used by the chemical company 
only in exceptional circumstances when there 
is no knowledge of the product type or how the 
transport service is organized. 

Level 2: to be used by the chemical company 
when there is knowledge of the product type 
but no knowledge of how the transport service 
is organized. 

Level 3: to be used by the chemical company 
when there is knowledge of the product type 
and the general nature of the transport service 
but the carrier has not provided the data 
required for calculation of the GHG emissions 
based on their primary data. 

The default road transport GHG emission 
intensities are calculated on the basis of using 
vehicles in the class “articulated truck up to 40 
tonne gross vehicle weight” using “Diesel, 5% 
biodiesel blend,” which industry data shows to 
be the predominant vehicle class. 

The values for dedicated transport are at the 
extreme, conservative end of the possible 
range with 50% empty running, assuming 
dedicated transport at the company level.  For 
a more accurate value, specific to your service, 
please consult with your service provider.  

For non-dedicated transport where a cleaning 
operation is required to facilitate operation with 
a lower level of empty running as compared to 
returning to base for cleaning then an additional 
86.6 kg CO2e per cleaning operation should be 
added (see section 3.10).

or short distance transport to/from site to 
assemble single wagon trains is assumed to be 
by diesel traction. 

Electric main haul assumes EU average 
electricity factor of 356 g CO2e/kWh.  Use of 
individual country mixes may give significantly 
different values, especially in countries with a 
highly decarbonized electricity supply. 

3.4 Inland waterways transport 

Inland waterways transport is well-suited to the 
generally larger consignments that are typical of 
the chemical sector and so the inland waterway 
default intensities in the main GLEC Framework 
are directly applicable to the chemical sector 
as follows:

The framing of international sea transport, 
whether deep sea or short sea (coastal) 
shipping is currently set by the International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO) 4th GHG Study,1 
which focuses on categorization of vessels by 
general type size categories.  This approach 
has been used to provide short sea and deep 
sea shipping values for chemical tankers, gas 
tankers and general cargo.  The values are 
based on the median fuel consumption for 
each size category with the addition of 10% 
of the range between lower and upper quartile 
values to avoid a risk of underestimation and 
adhere to the principle of taking a cautious 
approach to the use of default GHG emission 
intensities. Although shown in the same table 
below it is worth noting that short sea shipping 
within Europe is likely to be performed by 
the smaller vessel sizes whereas deep sea 
transport will more likely use the larger 
vessel sizes.

Care should be taken when calculating 
emissions from sea transport that distances are 
converted from nautical miles to kilometers to 
avoid systematic errors.

3.6 Air transport  

Table 9 
Intermodal transport TOC characteristics

Air transport is a relatively uncommon mode of 
transport for the chemical sector; hence, the 
guidance is to use the general values specified 
in the GLEC Framework. 

3.7 Pipeline transport 

The current data available suggests that the 
characteristics and performance of pipelines is 
highly variable making it difficult to represent 
reliably using a default GHG emission 
intensity. 

As many pipelines are owned by chemical 
companies, it is expected that emissions 
can easily be calculated from the energy 
consumption available to the pipeline owner, 
as follows (see also section 2.8): 

Total emissions = electricity consumption 
outside site boundaries x electricity emission 
factor (country specific, or EU average of 349 
kgCO2e/kWh) where the total tonne km = total 
tonnes transported in the latest year multiplied 
by the length of pipeline in km. 

Most pipelines have been shown to operate 
in the range 1 to 50 g CO2e/tkm, although 
instances of up to 360 g CO2e/tkm have 
been found in extreme circumstances (e.g. 
combination of short distance, uphill etc.).

3.8 Intermodal transport 

Intermodal transport involves the transport 
of a consignment by at least two transport 
modes, which necessarily have different 
operating characteristics, as well as a 
handling operation at a logistics site each 
time there is a change of mode.  As such, 
assigning a default GHG emission intensity 
to an intermodal transport is subject to a 
greater degree of uncertainty than to an 
individual transport mode - not only does it 
depend on the uncertainty associated with 
the assumptions for each individual transport 
element, but also the assumed length, and 
hence relative contribution, of each leg.  
Hence, the following scenarios should be 
seen as indicative; pre- and on- carriage are 
assumed to be by road transport.  These 
values also include the default values from the 
GLEC Framework of 1.3 kg CO2e / t or 10.7 kg 
CO2e per container moved.

Notes: 
Total distances in the above table are for 
Europe and based on Cefic survey data; 
deep sea based on transatlantic intermodal 
example. 

Includes GHG emissions associated with two 
transshipment actions, one at each end of the 
main haul. 

Additional information is provided in Annex 
2 (Intermodal GHG emission intensity 
by distance) which shows the variability 
according to total distance, distance share as 
well as an equation that sets out the impact 
on GHG emission intensity of varying these 
two distance parameters, keeping all other 
assumptions fixed. 

A worked example using different levels of 
information to show how a more detailed and 
accurate calculation can be achieved with 

better data and by calculating the emissions 
for every step in the intermodal chain including 
transshipment is provided in Annex 3. This 
would also allow the calculation of other 
modal combinations such as road + rail / 
barge + deep sea, for example in addition to 
the four default combinations.

3.9 Logistics Sites 

Information regarding GHG emissions from 
logistics sites in general remains relatively 
limited.  Hence, provision of default GHG 
emission values specifically for the chemical 
industry (including tank storage as well 
as transshipment and warehousing) is not 
possible and the guidance is to use the 
general values specified in Module 2 of the 
GLEC Framework. (Efforts will continue with 
GLEC members and partner organizations 
to add depth to the data regarding GHG 
emissions from logistics sites with a view 
to revising the data in future versions of 
the Framework.) It is recommended that 
companies request a value from the operator 
of the logistics site that represents the GHG 
emission per tonne of product throughput for 
their specific situation.

4. General guidelines for transport 
operators and logistics service 
providers 

This section briefly describes the steps 
a carrier, or LSP that operates transport 
equipment, must take in order to align with 
requirements of the GLEC Framework.  The 
main focus is guidance to be used by transport 
operators in the collection and processing of 
operational data.  Additional information is 
also provided for situations where operations 
are subcontracted, as is often the case for 
integrated, intermodal and specialist transport. 

4.1 Operational data collection 
and processing 

As set out in Chapter 2 of the GLEC 
Framework, the expectation is that the operator 
of the transport, irrespective of mode, will 
have access to the energy/fuel consumption 
information necessary to calculate their total 
emissions, based on the equation: 

GHG emission (mass of CO2e) = fuel / electricity 
consumption (per amount of energy used) x 
WTW emission factor (kg CO2e per amount of 
fuel used) 

So that a carrier can report information to their 
customer, which may be an LSP, in a way that 
is meaningful, it makes sense for the carrier to 
tailor the information to the customer’s needs 
by following some simple steps, as outlined 
below.  The intention is to provide transparency 
about the GHG emissions which the carrier 

produces while conducting transport on their 
behalf, so reducing: 

• the risk of incorrect reporting; 
• wasted time linked to incorrect or 
  incomplete reports 

and improving opportunities:
• to identify emission hotspots
• to make joint decisions to improve        
  efficiency / reduce emissions

STEP 1: Break up your total transport 
into categories 

For the information to be as relevant as 
possible it is important to break up your overall 
transport activities into different categories 
and then base your customer report on the 
category relevant to them.  The idea is that the 
characteristics of the trips within one category 
are as similar as possible (e.g. same type of 
truck, lanes, distances, type of load, etc.), so 
that the performance is clustered around a 
representative value. 

To perform the calculation you need to be 
able to identify the net tonnes of product 
transported and kilometers driven (both loaded 
and empty) associated with each category 
and specify the total fuel consumption for that 
category. 

In this step it is also good practice to engage 
with your customer to see if the categories you 
intend to use match their needs.  In the worst 
case you can combine everything together 
into one category for the whole business and 
decide how you could create more specific 
categories for the next reporting period.

STEP 2: Calculate fuel consumption 
by category

To determine the total GHG emissions for 
each category that is relevant to you and your 
customer, it is important that you know the fuel 
consumed in each category over the requested 
time period. 

The approach taken will depend on the maturity 
level of your organization, and may be based 
on the total amount of liters purchased, the 
average fuel consumption by type of truck in the 
fleet, or actual consumption monitored through 
telematics systems or refueling records. 

Ideally, the fuel data will be available as 
actual liters consumed per vehicle and it will 
be possible to assign the distance traveled, 
the amount of product transported and the 
associated fuel consumption by category 
from the bottom up.  In many cases individual 
vehicles will only operate in one category, 
but where that is not the case the operations 
should be assigned by category according to 
use.  Remember, you must include fuel used 
when the vehicle is empty and returning to 
base, transporting empty containers, traveling 
to cleaning, or to its next place of loading.

Calculating GHG transport

If primary fuel data is not available at the ideal, 
disaggregated level then you will either have to  

STEP 3: Calculate total GHG emissions 

Table 11 
Calculation based on average fuel consumption

Once you know the actual fuel consumption for 
the operation category, you can now calculate 
the related GHG emissions for each fuel using 
the emission factor for that fuel.  The emission 
factors will depend on the type of fuel and may 
vary by region.  The GLEC Framework contains 
standard factors for most common fuels; these 
may be updated occasionally, so always check 
the latest version of the GLEC Framework 
(Module 1).  For some more innovative fuels 
such as high blend biofuels your fuel supplier 
probably has its own certified value for the 
emission factor linked to the fuel that they are 
supplying. 

For example, if three different fuel grades are 
used within a single operation category as 
follows, the total GHG emissions would be 
calculated as shown on Table 13.

• work with averages of fuel consumption for   
  the different vehicle types. In that case 
  you need to know the actual total 
  kilometers (empty and full) driven by the 
   different vehicle types in each operation 
  category. For example see Table 11.

• or make top-down assumptions; for example,
  it could be that you make an estimate of the 
  share of the total fuel consumption for the 
  different operation categories based on your 
  knowledge of the proportions of vehicle  
  activity within your business.  For example 
  see table 12.

When you use either of these approximations 
it is important to check that when you add 
together the consumption of all the categories 
this matches the total consumption of your 
operation, so you are sure that all consumption 
has been accounted for. 

You may be consuming different fuel types 
(e.g. diesel, biodiesel blend, liquefied natural 
gas (LNG)) within one operation category.  
In this case you would need to determine 
the consumption of the individual fuel types 
separately in order to calculate the emissions 
correctly at Step 3.

STEP 4: Calculate the emission intensity 

When sharing information with your customer 
you may be happy to collect and share your 
primary data (fuel used and resulting emissions) 
with them so that they can see the full 
calculation shown in Step 3. This is most likely 
to be relevant for dedicated transport contracts 
where their volumes can more easily be 
identified. Alternatively, you may prefer to share 
the emission intensity of the transport operation 
that you provide on their behalf.  To calculate the 
emission intensity you need to know the total 
GHG emissions (from Step 3) and the amount of 
transport activity expressed in tonne kilometers. 

In this step you must calculate the transport 
activity for all the loaded trips in each category 
and add up the tonne kilometer values for each 
trip. This gives the total tkm of the category and 
can also accurately identify the tkm for your 

Table 14 
Calculation of transport activity 

individual customers. More detailed guidance 
on calculating transport activity is presented in 
Section 1 Chapter 2. 

Table 15 

Category

(kg CO2e)  

Total transport activity (tkm)  

GHG intensity kg

For a short example of the correct approach to 
calculate the transport activity, see Table 14.

Container carrying truck

128,000 

6,0000

0.060

0.088

The emission intensity is easily calculated 
by dividing the total emissions in a transport 
operation category by the tkm in that category.  
Using this information you can calculate 
emissions for each category, for example see 
Table 15.

By assigning total emissions to a transport 
operation category, and dividing it by the 
loaded tonne km, the calculated GHG intensity 
factor includes emissions linked with empty 
runs, cleanings, repositioning etc, for that 
transport category. Additional calculation 
examples are provided in Annex 3.

STEP 5: Carrier reporting to direct customer

Follow the guidance in Section 2 Chapter 1 on 
reporting. You should report the activities that 

you provide directly to each customer. This 
example shows your Bulk truck category and 
your Container carrying truck category.

*) In this case the emission calculations only cover road transport.  
**) Since you used your own actual fuel consumption and tonne 
kilometers, this calculation is considered based on primary data.  Had 
you received information from sub-contractors, that would need to 
be specified.  You could then list their total emissions as a separate 
line item in this overview.  Likewise, if you had used default values for 
a part of your business for which you have no actual consumption 
figures, you would have to state the percentage or which part of the 
business these defaults were used for. 
***) For extra confidence you could ask an independent 3rd party to 
verify the data and calculations, but this is not common yet. 
****) Please specify if actual or planned kms have been used

Note: if you provide a transport service with the 
same characteristics for multiple customers (e.g. 
a groupage service) it is acceptable to calculate 
the emission intensity for the combined service 
and report the same emission intensity to 
all customers that receive that service.  See 
the examples provided in Annex 3 for more 
information.

4.2 Managing data from 
subcontracted services 

It is often the case that for some elements of 
a transport service the carrier is providing the 
service to an intermediary that integrates the 
individual transport and logistics operations to 
provide the overall contracted service i.e. (some 
of) the actual operations are subcontracted.  
This often has an influence on the visibility of 
data within the contract chain and the way in 
which the final calculation is presented to the 
chemical company as the final customer.  
Three general situations are possible: 

• the transport provider does not operate 
  any transport services directly, instead 
  subcontracting all aspects to one or more  
  transport operators, possibly across different  
  modes of transport 
• the transport provider operates transport 
  services only in one mode and subcontracts  
  other modes where they are necessary in order  
  to complete the full transport operation, e.g.,  
  for intermodal transport services. 
• the transport provider operates transport  
  services only in one mode but sometimes  
  subcontracts some operations in order to  
  manage overall fluctuations in demand or  
  where a special vehicle is needed as part of a  
  broader contract. 

The main contractor should request the 
information from the transport operators in the 
format as set out in Section 4.1 and to use this 
information within its own reporting. To date 
this has not been common but is expected to 
become more so in the future as data and IT 
systems improve.  In cases where this data is 
not shared then the main contractor will need to 
rely on either detailed modeling (Section 5.3.2) 
or the industry defaults (Section 3) for those 
elements of the service that are subcontracted. 

For intermodal transport the main contractor 
is expected to report the total GHG emissions 
and the emission intensity of the full intermodal 
service, as set out in Section 2, Chapter 1. 

LSP reporting to chemical company 

Again this follows the guidance in the GLEC 
Framework on reporting, the so called “GLEC 
Declaration”. The LSP should report the 
activities that within the overall contract, 
whether provided using its own assets or 
those of subcontracted transport and logistics 
operators. The example report below is for an 
intermodal transport service as set out in more 
detail in Annex 3.

5. Guidelines for chemical 
companies per mode  

3. If the logistics service provider presents only 
the total GHG emission (i.e. total CO2 or CO2e) 
for each TOC: 

The intention is that the contracted transport 
provider will provide a report, as set out in 
Section 4 Step 5, presenting the results of 
GHG emission calculations aggregated for the 
transport they provide in each of the transport 
operation categories set out in Section 3. 

The reports provided should contain the 
information required for a chemical company to 
calculate its freight transport GHG emissions for 
each transport operation category by summing 
up the declared emissions across all carriers 
and all transport operation categories. 

a. Request the emission intensity and transport 
activity data for each TOC, as set out in Section 
4 step 5; 
b. If Step 3a fails, calculate the GHG emissions 
according to 5.1 in order to sense-check the 
total GHG emission value provided by the 
carrier for each TOC.  If in doubt, use your own 
calculation results and engage with the carrier to 
try to establish the reasons why they struggled 
to report fully. 

4. If the logistics service provider presents only a 
GHG emission intensity for each TOC: 

In cases where a logistics service provider 
fails to report, or does not report fully then the 
following procedures would apply: 

1. No data reported: Request the data in the 
format set out in Section 4 Step 5. 

2. If the logistics service provider presents only 
the total GHG emission (i.e. total CO2 or CO2e) 
covering all TOCs: 

a. Request the data as set out in Section 4 
Step 5, split out for each TOC; 
b. If step 2a fails, perform your own GHG 
emission calculation for each TOC according 
to 5.1. 

a. Request the emission intensity and transport 
activity data as set out in Section 4 Step 5; 
b. If step 4a fails, compare the GHG emission 
intensity provided with the default emission 
intensity for that TOC.  If you are satisfied 
that the GHG emission intensity provided by 
the carrier is credible then calculate the GHG 
emissions according to 5.1 using the GHG 
emission intensity provided carrier.  If in doubt, 
calculate the GHG emissions according to 5.1 
using the default GHG emission intensity for 
the TOC and engage with the carrier to try to 
establish the reasons why they struggled to 
report fully. 

5.1 Chemical company calculation 

5.2 Data checks 

In cases where the data provided by the 
logistics service provider is incomplete the 
chemical company should calculate the GHG 
emissions for each TOC using the following 
formula: 

GHG emission (mass of CO2e) = GHG 
emission intensity (mass of CO2e / tonne 
km) x transport activity (tonne kilometers) 

Use the GHG emission intensity provided 
by the carrier if you have confidence in it; 
otherwise use the default industry emission 
intensity for that TOC 

If the carrier provides a GHG emission 
intensity but not the associated tonne km 
there is a risk of underestimating the total 
emissions. In such cases an additional 
distance adjustment factor of 5% should be 
applied to allow for the typical extra actual 
distance traveled by the vehicle compared 
to the planned distance calculated by a 
route planner. 

GHG emission (mass of CO2e) = GHG 
emission intensity x chemical company 
estimate of transport activity x 1.05 

The factor of 1.05 should also be applied for 
groupage transport to allow for the additional 
distance that can result from the operator’s 
network or from diversions to pick up or drop 
off intermediate loads. 

Because reporting of GHG emissions between 
carrier and their customer is not yet common 
it is likely that in the early stages there will be 
errors in the data reported.  Common errors 
that could impact the carrier’s calculation that 
the customer should be aware of include: 

• Incomplete reporting. This is one reason 
   why it is useful to include the tonne km  
  value as part of the carrier report – because  
  the chemical company knows the amount of 
  transport contracted it should become clear 
  quickly if some of the transport activity has  
  been missed out. 

• Incorrect calculation of the transport activity  
  can lead to calculation of an incorrect  
  emission intensity. Follow the detailed 
   guidance in Chapter 2 of the GLEC  
  Framework. 

  Note: it is normal for the carrier’s transport   
  activity to be slightly higher than the chemical  
  company’s expectation, partly because actual  
  distance traveled is almost always greater   
  than the planned distance, even when the 
  origin, destination and route are known;  
  however, for groupage or LTL transport the  
  difference may be considerably higher 
   because the chemical company is unlikely to  
  know precise details of the carrier’s network  
  and the position of intermediate transfer 
  locations and depots can have a significant  
  influence on the total distance traveled.

• Use of incorrect emission factors – most  
  likely substituting a tank-to-wheel rather  
  than a well-to-wheel value. This would be    
  apparent through incorrect, probably lower,  
  total emission and emission intensities than  
  expected. 

• Failure to include the emissions from empty  
  running within the calculation.  This would 
   result in a systematically lower, total  
  emission and emission intensities than  
  expected and would be more noticeable for  
  dedicated transport where the level of empty  
  running is higher. 

• Inclusion of the weight of transport  
  equipment, such as containers or tank  
  containers, within the weight of the load  
  and hence the transport activity (tonne-km).  
  This would result in a systematically lower,   
  total emission and emission intensities than  
  expected. 

In the future, as this type of data sharing 
becomes more common it is likely that cost-
effective, commercial data verification services 
will become available.

5.3 Alternative Calculation approaches 

In addition to the use of aggregated data 
provided by the carrier, which is presented 
above as the standard approach to reporting, 
and the backup provided by the chemical 
sector default emission intensities presented 
in this report, other approaches are possible. 

5.3.1 Shipment level data 

5.3.2 Modeled Emissions 

Some examples of this may include: 

As noted in Section 4 Step 4, your carrier may 
be willing to share primary information with 
you so that you can see the full calculation.  
This would probably help to remove 
uncertainty regarding the approach taken 
and data used in the calculation.  Access to 
data at this level is most likely for dedicated 
transport where long-term contracts support 
a truly collaborative approach to operational 
efficiency.  In contrast, this approach is 
unlikely for shared transport options where 
it might reveal commercially confidential 
information. 

This level of data transparency can be useful 
to understand the underlying issues that 
influence GHG performance; however, as 
corporate reporting generally occurs at annual 
level it is more useful for proactively identifying 
opportunities for operational efficiency and 
emission reduction through gain sharing 

If you do have access to shipment level data 
in collaboration with your carrier, it is important 
to resist the temptation to exclude emissions 
linked to empty running.  For road transport 
the most widely accepted way to include the 
impact of empty running is to calculate the 
average level of empty running across the 
whole transport operation category and then 
apply this value to the emissions due to the 
loaded trips in proportion to the tonne-kms. 

Modeling of GHG emissions is a well-
established option – Smart Freight Centre 
has reviewed and accredited several such 
calculation tools as being in conformance 
to the GLEC Framework – see www.
smartfreightcentre.org for more current 
details.  The use of such models may be 
beneficial in that it should be possible to tailor 
the calculated values to match the specific 
characteristics of the transport that is being 
provided, rather than relying on the default 
values, which are, by their very nature, only 
generally representative. Modeling is also 
useful to assess the potential of different 
options to reduce emissions as a first step 
prior to investing in actual trials.

6. Recommendations for 
updating the defaults. 

Given the increasing focus on the severity of 
the global climate crisis and the importance 
that accurate and transparent GHG reporting 
has in tracking progress against sector and 
company emission reduction targets, the 
whole topic of GHG calculation and reporting 
is subject to ongoing technical and process 
updates.  Therefore, future updates to the 
GLEC Framework and these guidelines can be 
expected that might affect both methodology 
and approach to default emission intensities. 

• Revision of the levels of empty running  
  and typical load factors as better access  
  to primary data and changes to standard    
  industry practices become apparent 

• Revision of default GHG emission intensities  
  as updated emission factors for diesel are 
   published, new, lower emission fuels  
  become more commonplace for chemicals  
  transport in some or all modes 

• More detailed reporting requirements may  
  be put in place for carriers and/or shippers, 
  for example to split up the well-to-tank and 
  tank-to-wheel components of the overall 
  emission values. 

• Improvements in the way that baseline  
  data for specific modes are managed by the  
  legislative bodies. For example, the IMO is  
  aware of some overlap between the  
  different vessel categories, particularly  
  regarding chemical and oil tankers which use 
  different size classifications even though  
  some vessels may be used interchangeably;  
  there are also calls to move from the  
  use of vessel size classes to a continuous  
  relationship between vessel size and 
  expected emissions. These issues are being 
  reviewed at IMO level, and the outcome 
  of the discussions may result in a revised 
  approach to calculating default emission 
  intensities.

Annex 2: 
Intermodal GHG emission intensity by distance

The following graphs show the relationships 
between GHG emission intensity and distance 
for the four examples of intermodal transport 
presented in Section 3.8.  As noted there, 
assigning a default GHG emission intensity to 
an intermodal transport is subject to a greater 
degree of uncertainty than to an individual 
mode due to the greater number of variables.  
Hence, it must be noted that the graphs show 
the relationship only for a combination of 
one example loading and empty running for 
each of the pre-carriage, main transport and 
on-carriage; however, it is instructive to show 
that the emission intensity does decrease 
marginally as the logistics site emissions are 
spread over a greater transport activity.  At 
the same time the increase in total emissions 
per tonne of product moved has a close to 

linear relationship with distance, showing the 
impact of increasing supply chain distances 
on total GHG emissions, even when using 
an intermodal option.  The graphs also show 
how reducing the proportion of distance by 
road impacts on each of these intermodal 
combinations. 

The distance ranges shown are indicative of 
what might be expected of each intermodal 
combination but could be extended in either 
direction in exceptional circumstances. 

The relationship in each case is: 
Overall emission intensity = (% main mode 
distance x main mode emission intensity) + (% 
road distance x road emission intensity) + (2 x 
handling site intensity / total distance)

The following graph then shows how the modes compare with each other for a standard 10% pre- and on-carriage element 
by road.  It is worth noting that short sea distances can be considerably longer than rail or inland waterway depending on the 
exact route meaning that it is important to consider the exact options rather than relying solely on general emission intensities.

Calculating GHG transport

The report covers the whole of the month’s 
operations for its groupage operations for all 
customers.  The transport activity value is the 
amount of transport activity for this particular 
customer.  Without confirmation of the tonne 
km linked to this specific consignment the 
calculation would be:

GHG emission = 61.7 g CO2e/tkm x 10 t x 
250 km x 1.05 = 161.96 kg CO2e 

(The distance adjustment factor of 1.05 is 
applied as the provided GHG intensity is 
assumed to be based on actual distances if 
not stated otherwise) 

However, if the transport operator confirms 
that the actual transport activity of this 
consignment was 2600 tkm then the 
calculation can be refined to be: 

GHG emission = 61.7 g CO2e/tkm x 2600 
tkm = 160.42 kg CO2e

Annex 3: 
Example calculations

Chemical Company Calculations 

Road Example 1 

Level 3 Calculation 

Using the equation from Section 5.1 the GHG 
emissions can be estimated to be: 

GHG emission (mass of CO2e) = GHG 
emission intensity x customer estimate of 
transport activity x 1.05 

(The distance adjustment factor is applied 
due to the lack of information about the actual 
distance that the goods are transported for 
this groupage transport.) 

Calculation of GHG emissions for groupage 
transport to move 10 tonnes of packed goods 
between two points that are 250 km apart 
according to the shortest feasible distance 
by road. 

GHG emission = 95 g CO2e/tkm x 10 t x 250 
km x 1.05 = 249.38 kg CO2e 

Calculation using information provided by the 
carrier/LSP 

Given that the customer knows that the goods 
are being transported via a groupage transport 
then the starting point is the level 3 WTW GHG 
emission intensity of 95 g CO2e/tkm from the 
table in Section 3.2.

Level 3 Calculation 

Calculation of GHG emissions for groupage 
transport to move 8 tonnes of packed goods 
between two points that are 510 km apart 
according to the shortest feasible distance 
by road. 

Given that the customer knows that the goods 
are being transported via a groupage transport 
then the starting point is again the level 3 
WTW GHG emission intensity of 95 g CO2e/
tkm from the table in Section 3.2. 

GHG emission (mass of CO2e) = GHG 
emission intensity x customer estimate of 
transport activity x 1.05 

(The distance adjustment factor is applied 
due to the lack of information about the actual 
distance that the goods are transported for 
this groupage transport.) 

GHG emission = 95 g CO2e/tkm x 8 t x 510 
km x 1.05 = 406.98 kg CO2e 

Calculation using information provided by the 
carrier/LSP 

The report covers the whole of the quarter’s 
operations for its groupage operations for all 
customers.  The transport activity value is the 
amount of transport activity for this particular 
customer.  Without confirmation of the tonne 
km linked to this specific consignment the 
calculation would be: 

GHG emission = 54.9 g CO2e/tkm x 8 t x 510 
km x 1.05 = 235.19 kg CO2e 

If the transport operator is unable to 
confirm the actual transport activity of this 
consignment then the above is the best 
calculation available to the customer.

Using the equation from Section 5.1 the GHG 
emissions can be estimated to be:

Transport Company Calculations

Road Example 2 

This provides a simplified worked example 
of the procedure for a transport company 
to calculate its GHG emission intensity from 
hub and spoke groupage operations.  It 
is recognized that a full, real-life network 
calculation would include a lot more data and 
hence may need a specialist software solution. 

Vehicle operations included for each element 
of the transport chain, see Table 22.

The optimal calculation for a hub and spoke 
groupage operation is to separate the 
calculation of the collection and delivery 
element from the trunking element and for 
the collection and delivery element to use 
the direct distances between each of the 
collection and delivery points and the hub to 
allocate the emissions to each consignment.  
This removes the variability of the detailed 
emission calculation depending on where the 
consignment happens to be within the order of 
a particular round. 

In practice the above network value can 
be used to communicate the overall GHG 
emission intensity from the transport provider 
to their customer, with the customer using the 
5% distance adjustment factor to allow for 
this variation.

Intermodal Transport 

Level 2: intermediate information  

Level 3: detailed information  

Calculation of GHG emissions for ISO 
container on road/rail intermodal combination 
from Dormagen to Italy with a total distance 
of 1850 km.  The order consists of 7 
consignments totalling 120 tonnes.

With additional information the chemical 
company can refine the calculation and use 
the equation from Annex 2 with some of the 
modal default values from Section 3.  For 
example: 

Chemical Company Calculations 

The chemical company has various options 
depending on the amount of data available.  
These follow the levels introduced, along with 
the default values in Section 3 and reflect the 
amount of information available to them. 

Level 1: limited information  

With the bare minimum of information the 
chemical company should consult the table in 
Section 3.8 and combine the generic default 
value for intermodal rail transport of 32.5 g 
CO2e/tkm (based on 15% road transport by 
distance) with the total transport activity of 
the 7 consignments which is 120 x 1850 = 
222000 tkm. 

• The chemical company may know that road  
  transport is only 5% of the total distance. 
• The chemical company may choose to  
  use the average value for an ambient tank   
  container of 75 g CO2e/tkm for the road legs 
• The chemical company may choose to use  
  the average GHG emission intensity for a    
  track container of 17 g CO2e/tkm for the 
  rail leg 
• The chemical company can use the average  
  transshipment emission intensity of 1300 g/t  
  from the GLEC Framework for the transfer  
  between road and rail at each end of the  
  main haul. 

With these parameters the overall emission 
intensity = 0.95 x 17 + 0.05 x 75 +
(2 x 1300 / 1850) = 21.305 g CO2e/tkm. 

Additionally 7 lots of tank cleaning emissions 
should be added using the standard factor of 
86.6 kg CO2e .

Additionally 7 lots of tank cleaning emissions 
should be added using the standard factor of 
86.6 kg CO2e. 

Hence the level 1 total GHG emission 
is estimated to be 32.5 g CO2e/tkm x 
222000 tkm + 7 tank cleaning lots x 86600 g 
CO2e/tank cleaning = 7821200 g CO2e or 
7.82 t CO2e. 

Hence the level 2 total GHG emission is 
estimated to be 21.305 x 222000 + 7 x 86600 
= 5336000 g CO2e or 5.34 t CO2e. 

The chemical company may be able to use 
more detailed information regarding each leg 
to further refine the calculation as follows: 

Road leg 1 (pre-carriage) 
Distance is known to be 40 km 
Total product mass is 120 t across 7 
consignments, so average consignment 
weight is 17.1 t 

Rail leg (main carriage) 
Distance is known to be 1757.5 km 
Main carriage traction is known to be electric.  

From the table in Section 3.3 the GHG 
emission intensity for a track container with 
electric traction is 10 g CO2e/tkm 

Total transport GHG emissions for rail leg 1 
= 120 t x 1757.5 km x 10 g CO2e/tkm = 
2109000 g CO2e 

Tailored emission intensity for a payload of 
17.1 t and an average tank container empty 
running value of 19% is between these 4 
values from the table in Annex 1:

Transshipment 2 
The emissions for transshipment 2 are 
estimated to be the same as for 
transshipment 1. 

Road leg 2 (on-carriage) 
Distance is known to be 52.5 km 
In the absence of carrier specific data the 
emission intensity for road leg 2 is taken to 
be the same as for road leg 1, i.e. 88.3 g 
CO2e/tkm. 

Total transport GHG emissions for road leg 2 
= 120 t x 52.5 km x 88.3 g CO2e/tkm 
= 556290 g CO2e.

Leading to an approximate emission intensity 
of 88.3 g CO2e/tkm. 

Total transport GHG emissions for road leg 1 
= 120 t x 40 km x 88.3 g CO2e/tkm = 823840 
g CO2e.

Transshipment 1 
The average transshipment emission intensity 
for the transfer between road and rail is 
1300 g/t.  

Emissions between road leg 1 and rail 
transport = 1300 g/t x 120 t = 156000 g CO2e.
