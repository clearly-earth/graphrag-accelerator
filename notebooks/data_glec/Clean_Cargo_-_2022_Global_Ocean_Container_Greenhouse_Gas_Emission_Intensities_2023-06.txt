About Smart Freight Centre 

Smart Freight Centre is an international nonprofit organization 
focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from freight 
transportation. Smart Freight Centre’s vision is an efficient and 
zero emission global logistics sector. Smart Freight Centre works 
to guide the global logistics industry in tracking and reducing the 
industry’s greenhouse gas emissions by one billion tonnes by 
2030 and to reach zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, consistent 
with a 1.5°C future.

About Clean Cargo

Clean Cargo is a collaborative initiative between ocean container 
carriers, freight forwarders, and cargo owners.

Clean Cargo serves as a source of high-quality containership 
greenhouse gas emission performance information that supports 
members in their work to decarbonize containerized ocean cargo 
transportation. Specifically, the Clean Cargo secretariat collects 
operational and technical data from ocean container carriers to 
generate containership emission performance information that:

• Facilitates accurate greenhouse gas emissions inventory  
  calculations for Clean Cargo members.

• Guides member companies in making educated ocean freight  
  procurement decisions.

Clean Cargo also serves as a forum for decarbonization best 
practice sharing amongst members.

2022 Greenhouse gas emission 
performance information 

The emission performance information presented in this report 
is calculated according to the Clean Cargo methods for a series 
of Clean Cargo ocean container transportation trade lanes. The 
information in Table 1 represents average annual performance1  
across all reporting Clean Cargo ocean container carrier members. 
For 2022, there were 17 reporting Clean Cargo carriers. These 
carriers were responsible for approximately 85% of global ocean 
container freight capacity (by volume).

Clean Cargo emission intensities are based on emission factors 
that incorporate greenhouse gas emissions resulting from all 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto 
Protocol greenhouse gases (currently, carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen 
trifluoride (NF3)). The emission factors that underly the Clean Cargo 
emission intensities include emissions associated with the entire 
life cycle of the production and use of each energy source2.

Clean Cargo greenhouse gas emission intensities shown in Table 1:

• Are calculated based on each vessel’s nominal capacity,  
  assuming a 70% vessel capacity utilization factor. 

• Differentiate between emission intensities for refrigerated cargo  
  (refrigerated) and non-refrigerated cargo (dry) based on each  
  vessel’s nominal refrigerated container capacity and the vessel’s  
  reported number of days of operation.

• Reflect emissions associated with the entire life cycle of the fuel  
  consumed in the carriers’ vessels (that is, the Table 1 emission  
  intensities are “Well to Wake” intensities).

Clean Cargo carrier member data used in calculating the emission 
intensities undergoes third-party verification.

Additional information on the methods behind the emission 
intensities included in Table 1 is accessible here. 

1 Ocean cargo shippers and freight forwarders interested in carrier-specific emissions performance 
information are welcome to contact Smart Freight Centre at info@smartfreightcentre.org to learn 
more about membership in Clean Cargo.

2 Except in selected instances, where the emission intensities will be clearly marked “Tank to 
Wake,” or “TTW.”

Emission intensity trends 

Clean Cargo carrier carbon dioxide emission intensities for 2022, 
when averaged across all reporting carriers and across all trade 
lanes, were approximately 5% (dry) and 1.2% (refrigerated) lower 
than the 2021 emission intensities.3

Figure 1 2012-2022 trend in global average Clean Cargo carrier 
emission intensities (grams CO2 / TEU-km, assuming 100% vessel 
capacity utilization, and using Tank to Wake emission factors).

3  For most of the years between 2012 and 2022, Clean Cargo emission intensities were reported 
based on CO2 (versus CO2e), Tank to Wake emission factors, assuming 100% vessel capacity 
utilization. In order to present the longest meaningful time series, the percent change information 
discussed here (and the information shown in Figure 1) therefore reflects Tank to Wake CO2 
emissions and a 100% vessel capacity utilization factor.

 
 
 
 
7  CLEAN CARGO | 2022 GLOBAL OCEAN CONTAINER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITIES   

Potential drivers of 
the intensity changes 

The decreased fleetwide average greenhouse gas emission 
intensity for 2022 is likely to be the result of several related 
factors. It is difficult to determine the contribution of each factor 
to the decreased intensity without conducting a detailed analysis 
of global container fleet activities in 2022. However, contributing 
factors could include:

• Stabilization of marine transportation supply chains following  
  COVID-induced disruptions that impacted vessel activities    
  in 2021. Congestion and port delays, although still present 
  (especially at the start of the year), reduced in 2022 (compared 
  to 2021). Reduced supply chain disruptions may also be  
  associated with decreased vessel speeds. Above a certain  
  threshold, decreases in vessel speeds can be associated with  
  increases in the energy efficiency (per transport activity)  
  of a vessel.

• A slight increase of the average capacity of vessels for 2022   
  activities as reported through Clean Cargo. Provided that vessel  
  capacity utilization is high, larger vessels can often operate at  
  lower emission intensities than can smaller vessels. This factor  
  has been a significant driver in overall sector efficiency during  
  the past decade.

Using the 2022 emission 
performance intensities 

For further information on how to apply the 2022 Clean Cargo 
greenhouse gas emission intensities in greenhouse gas emission 
footprint calculations, please see the Global Logistics Emissions 
Council Framework.
