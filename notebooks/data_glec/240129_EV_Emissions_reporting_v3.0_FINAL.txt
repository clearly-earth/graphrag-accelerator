Executive Summary 

The  ‘Measuring  and  Reporting  the  Carbon  Footprint  of  Electric  Freight  Vehicle  Operations: 
Whitepaper’  is  part  of  Smart  Freight  Centre’s  series  on  road  freight  electrification,  which 
addresses the practical challenges of designing, implementing, and assessing the impacts of an 
electrification roadmap.  

This  whitepaper  provides  supplementary  guidance  on  calculating  operational  emissions  from 
electric vehicles, in alignment with the requirements and guidelines provided by ISO 14083, the 
global standard for emission calculation in transport chains.  
Electric vehicles play a vital role in significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions  from road 
freight, decoupling driving from energy production through innovative traction battery packs. With 
an anticipated emission intensity reduction of up to 85% in low-carbon electricity countries, EVs 
surpass  traditional  fuel  alternatives,  making  them  essential  for  achieving  sustainable  and  low-
emission logistics. 
Accurate emission measurement is vital for integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into operations and 
embedding  them  in  the  wider  logistics  ecosystem,  requiring  precise  reporting  to  meet  industry 
standards. The whitepaper, aligned with ISO 14083 and GLEC Framework v3, focuses on guiding 
the  measurement  and  reporting  of  operational  emissions  from  electric  freight  vehicles  within 
established  greenhouse  gas  emission  frameworks,  assuming  a  foundational  understanding  of 
ISO 14083. Additional guidance is needed in the industry especially due to the complex nature of 
EV charging behavior and strategy, the technical challenge related to charging infrastructure, and 
the unique requirements for electricity emission factors in the ISO 14083.  
The whitepaper covers the following topics: 
▪  Overall  reporting  rules  for  logistics  GHG  emissions  from  EVs,  based  on  GHG  Protocol 

standards and ISO 14083. 

▪  Considerations  when  selecting  electricity  GHG  emission  factors,  including  emission 

categories, market-based measures, and data sources. 

▪  Steps  to  quantify  GHG  emissions  from  an  EV  fleet  operation,  encompassing  electricity 
consumption,  energy intensity factors, and  aggregated emission  factors,  including charging 
infrastructure losses, based on ISO 14083. 

The proposed approach in the whitepaper aims to address the influence of the following factors 
in complicating the identification and derivation of an energy provision emission factor. Explicitly, 
the influences on the energy provision emission factors are: 
▪ 
▪  average energy contribution by behind-the-meter power generation, such as the facility’s solar 

the average grid electricity mixes of countries where charging activity takes place,  

panels, and  
the on-site electrical and charging infrastructure layout (see Figure below).

Illustration of electrical pathway through the on-site electrical and charging infrastructure.  

The whitepaper concludes by highlighting certain industry standardization challenges.  
▪  Lack of clarity over the  use of the market-based  method (e.g., using the  emission factor  of 
renewable energy explicitly purchased through energy attribute certificates market) by freight 
buyers. 

▪  The limited availability and accessibility of an electricity emission factor databases covering all 

ISO 14083-required emission categories and for all relevant locations. 

▪  The omission of losses from on-site electrical and charging infrastructure, affecting both the 
energy intensity factor of the vehicle and the resulting emission intensity factor of electricity 
use in EV operations, in the ISO 14083 standard. 

It emphasizes the need for collaboration, leveraging primary data and innovative approaches to 
achieve  standardization  and  practical  impact  in  energy  lifecycle  reporting  for  global  transport 
emissions. The ongoing efforts by Smart Freight Centre to address challenges and provide a path 
for  standardization  are  crucial,  inviting  organizations,  trade  associations,  and  governments  to 
unite  in  driving  significant  improvements  in  emission  performance  within  the  logistics  sector. 
Taking decisive action is essential for a sustainable and emission-conscious future.

Introduction 

The  ‘Measuring  and  Reporting  the  Carbon  Footprint  of  Electric  Freight  Vehicle  Operations: 
Whitepaper’  is  part  of  Smart  Freight  Centre’s  series  on  road  freight  electrification,  which 
addresses the practical challenges of designing, implementing, and assessing the impacts of an 
electrification roadmap.  

Electric  vehicles  (EV)  play  a  crucial  role  in  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  road 
freight sector. Unlike internal combustion engine trucks, EVs use a traction battery pack to store 
electricity, effectively separating driving activity from energy production. This not only eliminates 
tailpipe  emissions  but  also  provides  a  lower  lifecycle  emission  factor  based  on  a  much  higher 
primary energy efficiency and allowing for the widespread use of renewable energy. As Figure 1 
illustrates,  EVs could achieve an average emission intensity reduction in the  EU of about 35% 
and  up  to  85%  in  countries  with  low-carbon  electricity.  There  is  similar  emissions  reduction 
potential in the US as well, with the reduction potential expected to increase year on year due to 
the regional increase in renewable energy. In comparison, HVO100, itself an excellent low-carbon 
fuel with a potential reduction of 71%, is only available in selected locations and limited quantities 
(Smart  Freight  Centre,  2022).  In  conclusion,  EVs  provide  an  excellent  low  emission  transport 
service investment that will provide benefits in both the short and long term.

Companies  that  have  implemented  EVs  in  their  operations,  whether  directly  or  through 
subcontractors,  need to understand, measure and report their emissions accurately. Electricity 
emissions can vary widely depending on how electricity is generated, and more confusingly, in 
the final representation mix of sources delivered to the end user. While emission from electricity 
have been used for a long time for logistics sites and rail transport, the charging behavior from 
EVs and electricity emission factors are expected to vary widely, as this paper will discuss. If EVs 
are  to  be  used  as  an  emission  reduction  solution,  determining  the  correct  emission  factor  is 
crucial. What constitutes a correct emission factor, however, is dependent on the purpose of the 
calculation and the reporting framework that is used.  
In this pursuit, ISO 14083 “Greenhouse gases — Quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas 
emissions  arising  from  transport  chain  operations”  and  guidance  in  the  form  of  the  GLEC 
Framework version 3, offer the general principles for the calculation and serve as a guide for the 
inclusion  of  emissions  according  to  other  reporting  requirements,  such  as  the  GHG  Protocol 
Scope  2  and  Scope  3  standards.  However,  the  use  of  EVs,  the  charging  strategy,  charging

electrical infrastructure, as well as the energy provision from grid or other distribution channels, 
introduces a new layer of complexity and variability that are not as established as the fuel energy 
provision.  

1.1  Scope  

This whitepaper aims to address how operational emissions from electric freight vehicles are to 
be measured and reported within the existing greenhouse gas emission disclosure frameworks, 
the GHG Protocol standards and ISO 14083. This document presents supplementary information 
to  the  GLEC  Framework  v3  and  ISO  14083  specific  to  the  calculation  and  reporting  of  GHG 
emissions from electric vehicles in logistics operations, and as such assumes that the reader has 
a general understanding of the approach used for emissions and emission intensity calculations 
according  to  ISO  14083.  For  guidance  on  how  ISO  14083  is  applied  in  the  freight  sector,  the 
reader is directed to the GLEC Framework v3.  

1.2  Document structure 

This document provides guidance on how to report the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
electric vehicles (EVs) in logistics operations. It covers three main topics: 
▪  The overall reporting rules of logistics GHG emissions from EVs, based on the GHG Protocol 

standards and ISO 14083. 

▪  The  general  considerations  when  selecting  electricity  GHG  emission  factors,  such  as  the 
electricity emission categories, the inclusion of market-based measures, and data sources. 
▪  The step to quantifying the GHG emissions of an EV fleet operation, including the calculation 
of the electricity consumption and energy intensity factor, and the application of the aggregated 
emission factors including the losses from charging infrastructure.

2  Reporting rules of logistics GHG 

emissions from EVs 

This section compares the reporting requirements that are relevant to EV operations in the GHG 
Protocol  and  the  ISO  14083.  The  requirements  present  the  framework  and  context  in  which 
emission reporting takes place. Both frameworks have similarities but as they have different aims 
and scopes there are important differences that need to be kept in mind. 

2.1  Disclosure of GHG emissions according to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 

guidance.  

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies a company’s GHG emissions into three scopes 
(Figure 2). The reporting of scope 1 emissions (i.e., emissions typically from the combustion of 
fuels  from  owned  or  controlled  sources)  and  scope  2  emissions  (i.e.,  indirect  emissions  from 
purchased energy consumed by the company) are required. Scope 3 emissions, which is a broad 
category that includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain, is at this 
point optional, even if it offers the largest opportunities for GHG reductions.   

Figure 2 Overview of GHG Protocol scopes and emissions across the value chain (WRI & 
WBCSD, 2011) 

Emissions  from  EV  operations  are  divided  into  different  categories,  depending  on  the 
electricity  lifecycle  emission  categories,  and  the  role  of  the  reporting  company.  The  electricity 
lifecycle categories included in the GHG Protocol are: 
▪ 

“Power Generation”, emission from the combustion of fuel to generate electricity.

Measuring  and  Reporting  the  Carbon  Footprint  of  Electric 
Freight Vehicle Operations: Whitepaper  

“Fuel production”, emissions from upstream activities related to fuel production. 

▪ 
▪  Electricity “Transmission & Distribution” (T&D), emissions allocated to electricity losses due to 

the transmission and distribution of electricity, typically in the grid infrastructure. 

EV  operators  are  required  to  report  emissions  from  “Power  Generation”  in  scope  2,  and  may 
choose to report the emissions from “Fuel production” and T&D in scope 3 category 3 “Upstream 
fuel and energy-related activities”. 
Companies  that  have  purchased  the  services  of  EV  operators  are  only  required  to  report  the 
scope 2 emissions of their subcontractors in the scope 3 Category 4 “Upstream Transportation & 
Distribution” or Category 9 “Downstream Transportation & Distribution” (Smart Freight Centre & 
CDP,  2020).  Strictly  speaking,  the  scope  3  emissions  only  “include  the  scope  1  and  scope  2 
emissions of third-party transportation companies.” (WRI & WBCSD, 2011, p. 44).  
Table 1 provides a summary of the types of emissions related to EV operations that are accounted 
for under the different scopes.

▪  Fuel production, i.e., emissions from the extraction, production, and transportation of fuel. 

▪  T&D,  i.e.,  the  Scope  2  emissions  allocated  to  the  electricity  lost  in  transmission  and 

distribution 

▪ 

The two methods for calculating scope 2 emissions according to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Standard differ primarily in the type of electricity emission factor used. 
▪  The location-based method uses a grid emission factor that reflects average emissions for 
energy  consumption,  based  on  generation  as  well  as  any  net  physical  energy  imports  and 
exports, occurring within the time period and location of interest.  
In the market-based method, two types of emission factors are used. It allows for the use of 
a  specific  emission  factor,  associated  contractually,  to  the  purchase  volume  of  low-carbon 
electricity or its attributes (e.g., renewable energy contract or guarantees of origin). The other 
electricity volume will be calculated using a residual mix emission factor, that represents the 
unclaimed power generation mix of that location. This would typically be close to a fossil fuel 
power  generation  emission  factor  (AIB,  2022)  and  higher  than  the  location-based  emission 
factor.  

In both methods, the scope 2 emissions  are calculated by multiplying the  location-based or 
market-based  emission  factor  by  the  metered  electricity  consumption  in  megawatt-hours  (or 
kilowatt-hours). 
The GHG Protocol requires reporting scope 2 emissions using the location-based method, and if 
relevant,  using  the  market-based  method  under  what  they  consider  dual  or  supplementary 
reporting. In terms of purpose, the  location-based method tracks the emissions of the energy 
sector  within  a  geographic  boundary  (usually  a  country),  whereas  the  market-based  method 
tracks the purchasing choices of a single company.  Another practical reason is  to comply with 
different reporting programs, such as the RE100 (RE100, 2022).  
Unfortunately,  disclosing  Scope 3 based on  Scope 2 using market-based  reporting is not 
explicitly discussed in any of the Scope 2 or Scope 3 standards. Hence, it is unclear whether a 
Scope  3  disclosure  of  an  EV-based  transport  operation  using,  for  instance  renewable  energy 
credits  or  even  power  purchase  agreements,  can  be  calculated  based  on  the  market-based 
emission factor.  This issue is one of several that is being picked up in the current GHG Protocol 
round of consultation on Scope 2 and Scope 3 Standards and on market-based measures. Future 
versions may change how dual reporting is done.

2.2  Reporting emissions according to ISO 14083  

The  ISO  14083:2023  is  a  standard  that  provides  a  common  methodology  for  the 
quantification  and  reporting  of  lifecycle  GHG  emissions  arising  from  the  operation  of 
transport chains of passengers and freight.  
Emissions  from  vehicle  operations  in  the  ISO  14083  are  divided  into  two  major  categories 
(ISO, 2023). The vehicle operational GHG emissions are released to atmosphere as a result 
of  vehicle  operations.  The  vehicle  energy  provision  GHG  emissions  are  released  to 
atmosphere  during  the  process  of  producing,  storing,  processing  and  distributing  an  energy 
carrier for vehicle operation.  

Figure  3  The  ISO  14083  includes  operational  and  energy  provision  emissions  from  all 
transport and hub operations (Smart Freight Centre, 2023a). 
In the case of EV operations, the operational emissions are zero. Energy provision emissions, 
that is emissions from provision of electricity, includes all GHG emissions from “extraction, 
processing and transport of primary energy, power generation, power generation infrastructure, 
e.g.,  solar  panel  or  wind  turbine  manufacture,  grid  losses  associated  with  transmission  and 
distribution  of  electricity.”  (ISO,  2023,  p.  15)  The  emission  from  energy  provision  is  reported 
together, with the exception of emissions from power generation infrastructure, which may 
be  reported  separately.  Any  methodological  decision  to  omit  an  emission  category  must  be 
clearly stated and justified in accordance with cut-off criteria outlined in the subclause 5.2.3 of 
ISO 14083. 
ISO 14083 mandates that both transport service provider and transport service user report the 
total emissions arising from both operational and energy provision activities. Thus, both 
the fleet operator and the buyer of transport services must understand the type of electricity that 
was used in the operations to calculate the emissions.   
ISO 14083 requires the location-based method (as introduced by the Scope 2 standard) to be 
used  for  calculating  electricity  energy  provision  emissions.  In  this  method,  the  grid-average-
emission factors should be based on the average consumption mix of the grid (i.e., the electricity 
generated taking into account net physical import and export of electricity).  
The optional market-based method can be used in dual-reporting. While not explicitly stated, 
the  ISO  14083  standard  seems  to  allow  for  the  emissions  calculated  using  the  market-based 
method to be reported by other entities besides the EV operator.  
For example, if the transport service operator purchases a renewable energy certificate for the 
electricity  used  in  the  EV  operation,  the  operator  may  calculate  two  separate  transport 
emissions  and  emission  intensities,  corresponding  to  both  the  location  and  market-based 
methods. The transport service user may then include both sets of emissions and emission 
intensities in their ISO 14083 report.

2.3  Key differences between the standards 

The ISO standard, which was built on the work done in the GLEC Framework, was designed to 
be aligned with the GHG Protocol. Hence, both reporting requirements hold common elements. 
However, there are several key differences between their reporting requirements emissions from 
EV operations.  
These are briefly highlighted below.  
▪  Emission categories:  

– 

ISO 14083 also includes the emissions from  power  generation  infrastructure, albeit with 
the possibility of a separate reporting, or omissions, if justified. The implication is that non-
fuel renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind and hydropower) also have emissions. 
–  The GHG Protocol does not include this anywhere in the Scope 2 or Scope 3 standard. 

▪  Reporting responsibility and scopes:  

– 

– 

ISO 14083 mandates that both shipper and carrier are to include the total emissions from 
transport.  
In contrast, the GHG Protocol Scope 2 is mandatory only for the electricity user/purchaser 
(e.g.,  fleet  operator)  and  it  only  includes  ‘Power  Generation’  (i.e.,  Scope  1  of  power 
generation companies). Other lifecycle emissions (i.e., upstream fuel and energy-related 
activities) are reported optionally as part of the Scope 3 disclosure.

ISO  14083  allows  for  the  possibility  of  dual-reporting  (location-based  and  market-based 
methods) to be used by other companies besides the purchaser of electricity, i.e., outside 
scope 2.

3  Selecting electricity GHG emission 
factors according to ISO 14083 

This section presents several considerations when it comes to selecting energy emission factors. 
The  section  begins  with  a  general  understanding  of  what  is  included  in  an  electricity  GHG 
emission factor, primarily based on what ISO 14083  requires to be included. Next, the section 
provides  several  trends  based  on  the  energy  sector  and  policy  that  will  change  the  current 
electricity landscape in the upcoming decade. The third sub-section presents several ways that 
companies may use to reduce their EV-based emissions, primarily based on market instruments. 
Finally, the section ends with a brief comparison of several notable emission factor sources.  

3.1  Understanding GHG emissions from electricity 

Figure 4 shows the different stages of electricity, as well as the upstream (fuel production) and 
combustion (power generation) emissions. As the figure shows, part of the electricity produced is 
used for own-use, load-balancing (e.g. by pumping) and for trade. The difference between the 
supplied and consumed electricity is due to transmission and distribution losses. It is important to 
understand the type of emission factor that is used and to apply a correction factor based on best 
available knowledge, or to disclose any deviations from the ISO 14083 requirement.  

Figure 4 Carbon intensity from upstream activities to consumption (Moro & Lonza, 2018) 

The emissions from different types of energy sources are presented in Figure 5. An electricity 
consumption  mix  that  relies  on  fossil  fuel-power  generation  will  have  a  high  emission  factor. 
Renewables and nuclear are orders of magnitude lower than fossil-fuel power plants. The figure 
also shows why upstream emissions, which can be up to 100 gCO2e/kWh for fossil fuels (or 10 
to 20% of the total), should be included in the calculation.  
On  the  other  hand,  the  emissions  from  renewable  power  generation  infrastructure  range 
from 10 to 40 gCO2e/kWh. The emissions only become a significant portion of the total when the 
share  of  renewable  energy  is  high.  To  give  an  example  of  this  significance,  if  the  energy 

13 

                                                                                                                                   
 
 
 
 
 
Measuring  and  Reporting  the  Carbon  Footprint  of  Electric

consumption  is  based  on  half  natural  gas  and  half  solar  PV,  the  emissions  from  solar 
infrastructure would only constitute 9% of the total.  

Figure 5 GHG emission factors from electricity producing facilities in EU27 (Scarlat et al., 
2022) 

The trade of electricity drastically changes the consumption emission factor, depending on the 
average power generation emission factor of the exporting and importing country. For instance, 
the  electricity  emission  factor  of  Estonia  in  2019  dropped  by  one  third  due  to  the  import  of 
predominantly  low  carbon  electricity.  The  amount  and  type  of  energy  traded  can  drastically 
change from year to year, such as when there is a shortage in natural gas.  
Average  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D)  losses  are  different  depending  on  type  of 
voltage distribution (i.e., low to high voltage grid connections). The final consumption at high and 
medium voltage sites are about 1 to 10% lower than at low voltage sites, which translates to about 
1 to 78 g CO2e per kWh of consumption. This is not an insignificant difference. The EU average 
is 3 to 4% and 15 to 19 g CO2e per kWh of consumption. Nevertheless, most databases typically 
provide a national average for the T&D losses, which is suitable for emissions disclosure. 
The final consumption emission factor provides the most appropriate basis to then compare the 
emissions intensity of an EV and diesel truck. Figure 6 provides a country-level comparison for 
emissions from electricity consumption in European countries in 2019 (Scarlat et al., 2022), 
as well as a comparison with the emission intensity of a diesel truck (Smart Freight Centre, 2019). 
The values include fuel production, power generation, infrastructure, trade, and transmission & 
distribution  losses.  The  analysis  shows  that  approximately  half  provide  an  electricity  emission 
factor less than that of a diesel truck, and only 8 countries reduce emissions by at least 50%. An 
EV  operating within the  EU-27 would have an emission  intensity  reduction  of 16%. In  the US, 
based  on  eGRID  subregion  2021,  which  do  not  include  the  effects  of  fuel  production  and 
infrastructure, only 3 out of 27 regions provide an emissions reduction of more than 25%.

Figure 6 Full electricity emission factor for European countries in 2019 (Adapted data from 
Scarlat et al., 2022) 

3.2  Grid electricity environmental performance trends  

Globally, total emissions from the electricity sector have increased slightly in the past 3 years due 
to  increased  electricity  generation,  even  as  we  see  that  emission  intensity  has  reduced  (IEA, 
2023).  In  the  US  and  European  Union,  emissions  from  the  sector  reduced  slightly,  driven  by 
strong solar power performance. Nevertheless, these regions need to decrease much faster than 
before to meet its environmental commitments (https://www.eea.europa.eu/ims/greenhouse-gas-
emission-intensity-of-1, accessed 24 August 2023).  
One  of  the  primary  drivers  in  electricity  decarbonization,  which  also  has  the  sub-objective  of 
reducing electricity prices, is policy. Different types of policies have been introduced to provide a 
long term, sustainable and stable pathway towards decarbonization. In the EU, the Renewable 
Energy  Directive  II  has  provided  reduction  targets  for  the  energy  sector  of  individual  member 
states  to  achieve,  as  well  as  provided  the  basis  for  trading  certificates  (e.g.,  the  Dutch 
Hernieuwbare  Brandstof  Eenheden)  between  suppliers  to  meet  quotas  (Schneider  Electric, 
2018).  The  proposed  Renewable  Energy  Directive  III  (RED  III)  has  the  objective  of  RED  III  to 
increase the EU’s binding renewable energy target for 2030 from 32% to 45%, in line with the 
European Green Deal and the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 20501. Complementing the 
system  is  the  EU’s  Emission  Trading  Scheme  that  provides  a  cap-and-trade  mechanism  for 
reducing  emissions.  In  the  US,  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  is  expected  to  reduce  the  total 
emissions by more than 40% by 2030 (Roy et al., 2022), while demand is expected to increase. 
In summary, it would appear that, at least in the EU and US, the electricity market looks set on 
moving  in  the  right  direction.  However,  for  companies  located  in  certain  markets,  it  remains 
insufficient to make the short-term business and environmental case for electrification based on 
grid electricity emission factors.  

3.3  Obtaining low-emission electricity or certificates 

Several  resources  exist  to  support  companies  in  making  that  transition,  including  the  work 
conducted by RE100 (RE100, 2022). Four main approaches that companies can take to reduce 
electricity  emissions  compared  to  annual  average  grid  emission  factors  are  presented  below,

based on IEA (2022) “Advancing Decarbonisation Through Clean Electricity Procurement”. The 
purpose of listing them here is to illustrate the different options and to discuss their implications 
with respect to GHG emission disclosure. Companies should consider, together with specialist 
organizations, which approach should be taken, in alignment with their own goals and context. 
On-site  or  “behind-the-meter”  (BTM)  generation:  This  is  when  companies  invest  in  clean 
electricity generation to meet their own demand, such as installing solar panels on their rooftops 
or wind turbines on their premises. This option can reduce the company’s reliance on the grid and 
lower their electricity bills, but it may also require additional investments in storage, backup, and 
grid connection. This reduces the energy demand from the grid and therefore reliance on the grid 
emission factor and would be considered under the ‘location-based’ method. Figure 7 illustrates 
how the GHG Protocol treats the additional power generation. In the ISO 14083, which disregards 
the  scopes,  an  electricity  emission  factor  for  both  the  on-site  generation  and  the  grid  must  be 
applied for the volumes of electricity consumed respectively.

(Source: World Resources Institute, 2015) 

Power purchase agreements (PPAs): These are long-term contracts between a consumer and 
an electricity producer, where the consumer agrees to buy a fixed amount of electricity at a fixed 
price for a fixed period. The producer can be either an existing or a new clean generator, and the 
contract can be either physical (where the electricity is delivered to the consumer) or virtual (where 
the electricity is sold to the grid and the consumer receives the price difference). While there may 
be  a  variety  of  different  conditions,  the  physical  PPA  could  be  counted  in  the  location-based 
method under the “Direct Line” category (WRI, 2015). The virtual approach, also called a finance 
PPA, would provide a renewable energy certificate and an associated emission factor eligible to 
be  used  in  a  market-based  method.  With  the  finance  PPA,  reporting  using  the  location-based 
method will have to use the grid emission factor.

Green tariffs and green power products: These are short-term contracts for procurement of 
renewable electricity provided via the grid. The supplier-specific emission factors may be used in 
the market-based method, whereas reporting using the location-based method will have to use 
the grid emission factors.  
Energy attribute certificates (EAC): These are tradeable credits that can include attributes such 
as type  and time of generation. For example,  a company can buy green  electricity certificates 
(e.g. GOs in  Europe or RECs in the US) to match its  consumption with clean generation from 
existing plants. The emission factors associated with the EACs and the residual energy mix may 
only be used in the market-based approach. While these are typically used for annual matching, 
time-dependent EACs may be used for more granular matching of consumption and supply. This 
type  of  matching  allows  companies  to  adjust  their  charging  activity  to  match  periods  of  higher 
renewable energy availability (e.g., during the day, when solar PV is most effective).  Note that 
the option to accept more granular time-dependent EACs is being considered in the current Scope 
2 Guidance revision (WRI, 2023).

3.4  Emission factors and databases 

Emission  factors, used  in  both the location-  and market-based  methods, are subject to  quality 
criteria stated in ISO 14083 “Annex J.3”. However, obtaining the right emission factors, especially 
for  the  location-based  method,  is  not  simple.  Table  2  compares  several  prominent  databases. 
Regardless  of  the  methodological  selection,  reporting  entities  are  required  to  state  clearly  the 
emission factor source, why it was selected, what it includes, as well as provide reasons for any 
deviations from the requirements of ISO 14083.  
The ISO 14083 standard recommends using the best available national GHG emission factors. 
For reporting entities with a global footprint, the IEA Emission Factor database, updated annually, 
would seem  to  be sufficiently  practical. However,  as the Table  illustrates, it does  not currently 
cover the full spectrum of emission categories. In our opinion its failure to include emissions from 
fuel production is its biggest deficiency. Another aspect to bear in mind that there is generally a 1 
to 2 year lag in official data being published. This can become longer (easily 3 years) in documents 
like the IEA  who need to wait for a country's data to be published before they include it in their 
own lengthy publication process. 
Other  national  databases  or  emission  factors,  such  as  supplied  by  the  Dutch,  UK  and  US 
government, typically provide consumption emission factors, which includes power generation, 
trade effects, and transmission and distribution losses. The Dutch database, however, provides 
the fuel production emission factors, and as reference the emissions from infrastructure, based 
on the analysis CE Delft (2022).  
EcoTransIT World (2023) provides emission factors at the country-level but does not adjust for 
trade.  In  other  words,  the  electricity  mix  is  based  on  generation,  rather  than  consumption. 
EcoInvent, which actually serves as the underlying lifecycle analysis database for many of the 
different customer-facing databases, provides a consumption-level data and at different voltage 
levels  (https://ecoinvent.org/the-ecoinvent-database/sectors/electricity/,  accessed  25  August 
2023). While detailed, one should note that application of the Ecoinvent database requires a high-
level of LCA expertise.

If compromises are inevitable, for instance if the emission factor does not include all categories, 
the selection of database and emission factor should be dependent on the expected size of the 
impact.  For  instance,  in  Europe  the  impact  of  trade  is  significant  and  should  be  included. 
Construction emissions on the other hand do not make a significant difference in most European 
countries,  except  where  renewable  electricity  makes  up  most  of  the  consumption,  such  as 
Sweden and Iceland. The selection should be transparent and  sufficient justification should be 
provided, as per the ISO 14083 cut-off criteria.

4  Quantifying the GHG emissions of an EV 

fleet operation 

The steps to quantify the GHG emissions of a transport operation are described in the ISO 14083, 
as  well  as  the  GLEC  Framework  v3,  in  Section  1.  The  approach  is  bottom-up,  where  the 
calculation for a full transport chain is performed at subdivided parts, called the transport chain 
element (TCE). For a vehicle, the TCE is defined as “the part of  transport chain where freight is 
carried by a single vehicle”.  
The general steps to calculate emissions of a vehicle-TCE are. 
1.  Calculate the transport activity, typically in tonne-kilometers (tkm), of the TCE.  
2. 

Identify the applicable emission intensity of this TCE by establishing the relevant  transport 
operation category (TOC).  

3.  Calculate the TCE’s emissions by multiplying the transport activity by the emission intensity. 
The use of EVs does not  introduce  any new complexity in  Steps 1 and 3. However,  there are 
additional  considerations  to  be  taken  to  perform  Step  2,  which  is  to  identify  the  applicable 
emission intensity, correctly.  
This section will focus on how to determine the emission intensity factor used for an EV operation. 
Readers are advised to refer to the GLEC Framework v3 to familiarize themselves with Steps 1 
and 3.  
The steps to calculate the TOC-level emission intensity factor are the following. 
1.  Calculate  TOC-level  energy  intensity  factor  in  kWh  per  tkm,  whether  based  on  primary  or 

other data sources. 

2.  Calculate TOC-level emission intensity in g CO2e per tkm, based on the electricity emission 

factors, and other losses to be accounted for.   

This section discusses how to address some of the additional complexities in the steps above, 
when it comes to EVs.  

4.1  TOC-level energy intensity factor 

The  estimation  of  the  energy  intensity  factor  of  a  vehicle  operation  should  proceed  based  on 
primary data, if available. Figure 8 illustrates some of the primary data sources available along 
the electricity pathway from the grid meter to the vehicle.  

19

Figure 8 Illustration of electricity pathway from grid meter to vehicle and the various data 
sources available 
As the TOC energy intensity factor is representative of the energy  consumed at the vehicle, in 
calculating  energy  consumption  based  on  either  the  metered  data  or  charging  activity  data 
sources, a downward correction factor towards the vehicle should be applied (Table 3).  
For example, a measurement of 100 kWh, based on metered data, could translate to only 90 kWh 
consumed by the vehicle. In this example, 10 kWh is lost due to charging losses for every 90 kWh 
charged by the vehicle.

Type of data 

Description 

Correction factor 
towards the vehicle 

Metered energy 
consumption 

Metered energy consumption data represents the total electricity 
consumed at the charging facilities, i.e., all charge points at the 
same facility, whether from the grid or on-site power generators.  

Charging activity 
data 

Rich charging activity data can provide for each vehicle the time, 
duration, and amount of charging. In some cases, the charging 
losses may also be estimated by the system. 

Vehicle telematics 
data 

Vehicle telematics data and, more specifically, that related to the 
battery management system can provide charge activity data as well 
as granular data on energy consumption. 

Default or modelled 
energy intensity 
factor 

Default energy intensity factors are typically based on energy 
consumption at the vehicle, and do not include charging losses or 
any other. In this way, they try to replicate the energy intensity factor 
derived from vehicle telematics data.

The size of the correction factor should be determined based on the charging losses in a typical 
operating  condition.  This  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the  electrical  layout  of  the  charging 
infrastructure  (Apostolaki-Iosifidou  et  al.,  2017).  Some  installations,  in  addition  to  the  charging 
equipment  (external  and  on-board),  will  require  an  on-site  transformer  or  power  converter. 
Charging  efficiency  for  typical  fast  charging  DC  equipment  is  estimated  by  equipment 
manufacturers to be between 83 to 95% (Rajendran et al., 2021). However, operating conditions, 
such as hot weather, could also drastically affect efficiency.  
For  use  in  ISO  14083  reporting,  it  is  not  recommended  to  estimate  energy  intensity  based  on 
energy consumption or driving range values provided by manufacturers. They typically reflect a

requirements  rather  than  reflecting  real-world  conditions.  However,  they  may  be  helpful  for 
planning purposes in the absence of better data.

4.2  TOC-level emission intensity 

When calculating emissions for EV operations, it's crucial to consider both the electricity emission 
factor (outlined in Section 3.4) and potential losses at specific charging locations, as shown in 
Figure 8. As EV fleet operations often involve charging at various locations, especially in regional 
and long-haul scenarios, the emission factor calculation requires careful attention. For instance, 
in long-haul operations, carriers are expected to mainly charge  at their truck depots overnight. 
However, additional charging to extend driving ranges may occur at destinations during loading 
or unloading or en-route at public or highway charging stations, potentially in different countries. 
Explicitly, the influences on the energy provision emission factors for the TOC are: 
▪ 
▪  average energy contribution by behind-the-meter power generation (see Section 3.3), such as 

the average grid electricity mixes of countries where charging activity takes place,  

the facility’s solar panels, and  
the on-site electrical and charging infrastructure layout (see Section 4.1).  

▪ 

To systematically take these factors into account, and also to account for the likely changes in 
grid emission factors, we propose that two additional variables are included. 
Net electricity emission factor: This factor is specific to the charging location. It is the weighted 
average emission factor for all the sources of electricity used in the charging station: a location-
specific grid emission factor and multiple emission factors from behind-the-meter (BTM) power 
generation. This aligns with the illustration in Figure 7.

𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 + ∑ 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐵𝑇𝑀

Charging  location  energy  correction  factor:  As  discussed  in  Section  4.1  and  illustrated  in 
Figure  8,  there  may  be  charging  losses  from  the  on-site  electrical  and  charging  infrastructure, 
which will reduce the electricity delivered to the vehicle. This value represents the ratio between 
the amount of electricity in kWh transferred to the vehicle and the amount of electricity measured 
at the meter. There is insufficient empirical data to provide an industry-wide estimate, hence at 
this point, we recommend a conservative value of 1.11 to represent losses of 90% from meter to 
vehicle. 
Multiplying both the net electricity emission factor and the charging location correction factor leads 
to  a  corrected  emission  factor  associated  to  that  charging  location.  The  corrected  emission 
factors for each charging location can be aggregated to a TOC-level emission intensity using the 
equation below, where 𝑖 is the index representing a charging location. The aggregation proceeds 
based on amount of energy charged at a location, or more generally the percentage of charging 
activity carried out at each location.

Based  on  the  corrected  emission  factor  and  charging  activity  share,  an  aggregated  emission 
factor can be calculated. In the example above, it amounts to 129 g/kWh. If the energy intensity 
of the fleet is taken as 0.17 kWh/tkm (Smart Freight Centre, 2023a), the TOC emission intensity 
can be calculated as 22 g/tkm. In the normal methodology used by carriers or shippers, reporters 
can the TOC emission intensity and multiply it by that TOC’s annual transport activity to calculate 
the annual emissions of the EV operations.

5  Conclusion 

This  whitepaper  aims  to  clarify  the  measurement  and  reporting  of  operational  emissions  from 
electric  freight  vehicles  within  existing  greenhouse  gas  emission  frameworks,  including  GHG 
Protocol standards and ISO 14083. It begins with a high-level comparison of these standards and 
further explores considerations for selecting electricity GHG emission factors according to ISO 
14083  requirements.  The  paper  also  adapts  the  ISO  14083  method  to  quantify  operational 
emissions,  considering  the  use  of  EVs,  charging  strategy,  electrical  infrastructure,  and  energy 
provision.  While  aligned  with  ISO  14083,  certain  industry  standardization  issues  remain, 
summarized below for consideration. 
One area of unclarity is the use of TOC emission intensity factors using the market-based 
method.  While  the  Scope  2  standard  and  ISO  14083  allow  for  dual  reporting  by  transport 
operators (or electricity users), the use of the resulting emission intensity factor by the user or 
buyer of the transport service, in Scope 3 reporting or as Transport Service User in ISO 14083, 
is not explicitly mentioned. Although ISO 14083 allows for the results based on the market-based 
method to be “used for a product carbon footprint in accordance with ISO14067” (ISO, 2023), it 
is unclear whether the transport service user may use emission intensities calculated using the 
market-based method. Further clarification is needed in the industry, as the publication of Smart 
Freight  Centre’s  “Voluntary  Market  Based  Measures  Framework  for  Logistics  Emissions 
Accounting and Reporting” (Smart Freight Centre, 2023b) suggests. 
Another area of uncertainty is the limited availability of comprehensive electricity emission 
factor databases covering all relevant locations. As explained in Section 3.4, the widely used 
IEA database lacks coverage for all emission categories. From our survey (see Table 2), only two 
emission factor sources offer comprehensive coverage: one for a single country, the Netherlands, 
and one extensive database used for life cycle assessments, namely the Ecoinvent database. 
While sustainability reporters often resort to accessible databases like the IEA, which also offer 
broad  coverage,  their  exclusion  of  emissions  from  fuel  production  and  power  generation 
infrastructure may necessitate an equally credible and widely applicable database encompassing 
all emission categories, including upstream emissions. The absence of such a database could 
limit the practical impact of achieving comprehensive energy lifecycle reporting in ISO 14083 for 
future global transport emission reporting. 
Additionally, ISO 14083 overlooks losses from on-site electrical and charging infrastructure, 
affecting both the energy intensity factor of the vehicle and the resulting emission intensity 
factor  of  electricity  use  in  EV  operations.  The  evolving  nature  of  the  current  charging 
landscape, especially for medium to heavy-duty vehicles, makes defining typical charging location 
correction factors premature. Nevertheless, it becomes essential to include this as an emission 
category,  allowing users to calculate values based on primary data  and taking a step  towards 
standardizing EV emission calculations. 
Looking  ahead,  it  is  crucial  for  the  industry  to  unite,  leveraging  primary  data  and  innovative 
approaches for standardization. This collaborative effort is vital to ensure the practical impact of 
energy lifecycle reporting and to establish a strong foundation for the future  of global transport 
emission reporting. Smart Freight Centre's ongoing work in clarifying technological and sectoral 
challenges in logistics emission accounting, and in providing a clear path for standardization, is 
invaluable. We invite organizations, trade associations, and governments to actively join hands 
in addressing these challenges together. Taking decisive action on this initiative is essential for 
driving significant improvements in emission performance within the logistics sector.
