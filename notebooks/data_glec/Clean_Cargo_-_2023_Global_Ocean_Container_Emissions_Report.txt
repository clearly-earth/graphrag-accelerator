Smart Freight Centre (SFC) is an international non-profit organization 
focused on reducing the emission impacts of global freight 
transportation. Smart Freight Centre’s vision is a zero-emission 
global logistics sector by 2050 or earlier, consistent with 1.5° 
pathways . Smart Freight Centre’s mission is to accelerate the 
reduction of logistics emissions by fostering collaboration within 
the global logistics ecosystem . 

The SFC’s goal is to mobilize the global logistics ecosystem, 
particularly members and partners, to track and reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions to achieve 1.5° pathways . 

Clean Cargo

Clean Cargo is a collaborative initiative between ocean container 
carriers, freight forwarders, and cargo owners. 

Clean Cargo serves as a source of high-quality containership 
greenhouse gas emission performance information that supports 
members in their work to decarbonize containerized ocean cargo 
transportation. Specifically, the Clean Cargo secretariat collects 
operational and technical data from ocean container carriers to 
generate containership emission performance information that: 

• Offers access to primary data following the GLEC standardized  
  framework and ISO 14083. 
• By providing a standardized methodology and guideline for  
  measuring and reporting carbon emissions associated with 
  ocean container carriers enables members to identify areas for   
  improvement and track progress in reducing emissions.  
• Facilitates accurate greenhouse gas emissions inventory  
  calculations for Clean Cargo members. 
• This data-driven approach allows members to make informed    
  decisions about their supply chain choices on ocean 
  freight procurement decisions to minimize their carbon   
  emission impact.  

Clean Cargo also serves as a forum for sharing best practices for 
decarbonization amongst members.

2023 Greenhouse gas emission 
performance information 

The emission performance information presented in this report is 
calculated using the Clean Cargo methods for a series of ocean 
container transportation trade lanes. The information in Table 1 
represents the average annual performance1 across all reporting 
Clean Cargo ocean container carrier members. For 2023, there were 
18 reporting Clean Cargo carriers. These carriers accounted for 
approximately 88.3% of global ocean container freight capacity (by 
volume). By number, Clean Cargo carriers operated 4098 cellular 
vessels, representing 68.6% of the total container vessels at the 
end of 2023. 

Clean Cargo emission intensities are based on emission factors that 
incorporate greenhouse gas emissions related to combustion and 
energy use resulting from all United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases (currently, CO2, 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen 
trifluoride (NF3)). The emission factors that underly the Clean Cargo 
emission intensities include emissions associated with the entire life 
cycle of the production and use of each energy source. 

Clean Cargo greenhouse gas emission intensities are shown in Table 1: 

• Are calculated based on each vessel’s nominal capacity,  
  assuming a 70% vessel capacity utilization factor 
  (roundtrip voyage).  
• Differentiate between emission intensities for refrigerated cargo  
  (refrigerated) and non-refrigerated cargo (dry) based on each  
  vessel’s nominal refrigerated container capacity (reefer plugs) and  
  the vessel’s reported number of days of operation. 
• Reflect emissions associated with the entire life cycle of the fuel  
  consumed in the carriers’ vessels (that is, the Table 1 emission   
  intensities are Well-to-Wake intensities). 

Clean Cargo carrier member data used in calculating the emission 
intensities undergoes third-party verification. 

Additional information on the methods behind the emission intensities 
included in Table 1 is accessible here.

7  CLEAN CARGO | 2023 GLOBAL OCEAN CONTAINER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITIES   

Overall trends  

Geopolitical tensions continued to leave their mark in 2023. 
Russia-Ukraine war and deteriorating US-China relations strained 
the atmosphere on the global stage. The complexity deepened with 
the eruption of the Israel–Hamas war in October. The world has 
again become more fragmented, with widespread consequences 
for the global economy and trade. The year saw a gradual easing of 
inflationary pressures from peak levels. However, economies are still 
experiencing inflation at elevated levels, forcing central banks to act 
and posing ongoing challenges for the global economy. Striking a 
delicate balance between taming high inflation and fostering economic 
growth remains a crucial concern for central banks worldwide. 

Technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated 
during 2023, bringing a wave of optimism to the shipping industry. 
AI’s potential contribution to reducing emissions and improving 
energy efficiency is gaining prominence, paving the way for a more 
sustainable future for global seaborne transport.  

World seaborne trade volumes increased by around 3% in 2023. 
However, the increased cost of living has shifted consumption 
patterns, leading to decreased demand for containerized goods and 
container vessels. This shift in consumer behaviour has significantly 
impacted the shipping industry, affecting both trade volumes and 
vessel demand.   

The shipping industry is volatile, and shipowners are used to 
adjusting accordingly. During 2023, container shipowners and 
operators reduced vessel speeds and idled capacity to cope with 
the significant fall in demand.  

The climate agenda is front and centre in the shipping industry. No 
silver bullets exist, but the maritime sector is fortunate to navigate a 
global regulatory framework governed by the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO). In 2023, the IMO reached a consensus to tighten 
GHG regulations, closing some of the gap with the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement. Starting in 2024, the shipping industry will begin 
operating by new rules introduced by the IMO. 

The IMO has introduced technical and operational measures to 
ensure the shipping industry reduces its climate footprint. The 
Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) requires new vessels to be 
built to reduce the industry’s climate impact. At the same time, the 
Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) targets the operational efficiency of 
existing vessels. 

 
 
 
 
 
8  CLEAN CARGO | 2023 GLOBAL OCEAN CONTAINER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITIES   

Regional initiatives supplement global regulations. The European 
Union has included the shipping industry in its Emission Trading 
System (ETS) from 2024. This introduces a carbon tax on CO2 
emissions from vessels entering EU ports. Moreover, a vital 
component of the EU’s Fit for 55 packages is the FuelEU Maritime 
initiative, which aims to stimulate demand for renewable and low-
emission fuels in the maritime sector. The FuelEU Maritime regulation 
is expected to take effect in 2025. 

The container market has continued its downward ride after stellar 
years during the pandemic.  

The fleet’s cargo-carrying capacity increased significantly during 2023, 
when high inflation and soaring interest rates reduced demand for 
containerized goods. As a result, both freight rates and second-hand 
ship prices experienced substantial declines. A massive inflow of 
vessels is still projected for 2024 and next year, while high inflation is 
expected to continue to weigh on the outlook for the global economy. 
The container market is, therefore, expected to suffer from surplus 
vessel capacity in the coming years, likely leading to further declines 
in freight rates and increased scrapping of vessels.

 
 
9  CLEAN CARGO | 2023 GLOBAL OCEAN CONTAINER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITIES   

Potential drivers of 
the intensity changes 

The volume of international maritime trade has steadily increased 
over the last decade, with over 80% of world merchandise trade 
shipped by sea. Efficient, environmentally friendly, and low-cost 
maritime transport systems that connect global supply chains are the 
driving force for sustainable economic growth.  

Given the competitive business environment, an ocean container 
shipping company seeks efficient freight solutions through on-
time delivery by enhancing service schemes and fleet deployment. 
Finding the optimal routes, schedules, and plans for a fleet of various 
container vessels is challenging and becomes more so when, in 
most cases, considering the uncertainty that governs the maritime 
shipping environment. 

Uncertainty in maritime transport is either because of variations 
in operating parameters or unexpected disruptions. Some important 
operation parameters relate to port bottlenecks, container terminals, 
and waiting time before berthing. Unexpected disruptions refer to 
rare or one-off occurrences, like port closure, congestion, berth 
prioritization, and inclement weather. This is significant for an ocean 
container carrier with many container vessels dispersed in the seas. 
For example, on November 19, 2023, missiles were fired from 
Houthi rebels in Yemen, backed by Iran and siding with Palestine in 
the conflict. This happened in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab 
Strait. The situation risks seafarers’ lives and is unsustainable for 
global trade.  

Subsequently, Ocean Container Lines announced diverting several 
vessels due to the threat in the Red Sea, giving new extended 
sailing plans through the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. It is a similar 
example; in March 2021, a 20125 TEU container vessel, buffeted by 
winds, blocked the Suez Canal for six days, resulting in a long queue 
of vessels lining up to pass, delaying reaching their destinations on 
time. In this regard, 70–80% of vessel round trips experience delays 
(sometimes for days) in at least one port. (See following Chart 1)

Ocean container vessels need to take several countermeasures to 
reduce the adverse effects of sudden disruptions. A vessel’s schedule 
can be recovered by actions like (a) omitting a port, (b) adjusting the 
vessel speed, and (c) swapping the order of ports. To mitigate delays 
caused by one or more call ports, a ship would increase its speed to 
get back on schedule, significantly increasing the fuel consumption 
rate and, consequently, the amount of CO2 emitted.  However, 
swapping of call ports is impractical for a vessel with a fixed order 
of calls or one that needs to load and unload goods. 

 
 
11  CLEAN CARGO | 2023 GLOBAL OCEAN CONTAINER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITIES   

What factors might have contributed to the decreased fleetwide 
average greenhouse gas emission intensity for 2023, and could 
other external factors influence this reduction? 

The decreased fleetwide average GHG emission intensity for 2023 
compared to 2022 can be attributed to several factors closely related 
to better fleet operations. Reduced port congestion has led to fewer 
speed-ups, resulting in more balanced and lower average speeds 
(See Chart 2). This operational improvement directly affects carbon 
intensity, as vessel congestion negatively impacts it. Therefore, 
alleviating congestion has contributed significantly to the reduction 
in carbon intensity.

Improvements to existing vessels, such as modifications to the 
bulbous bow and other retrofitting measures, along with adding 
significant new buildings to the fleet, have further supported 
emission reductions. The stabilization of maritime transportation 
supply chains following COVID-induced disruptions that impacted 
vessel activities in 2021 and 2022 has also played a role. As vessel 
operations normalize (See Chart 3), the need to increase speed to 
recover from delays decreases, allowing for more opportunities for 
speed optimization.

Another contributing factor is the high vessel capacity utilization. 
Larger vessels, when fully utilized, often operate at lower emission 
intensities than smaller vessels. If the increase in capacity is due to 
the upsizing of each vessel, it leads to an improvement in carbon 
intensity. The fleet’s upsizing and the anticipated positive effects of 
this on carbon intensity also support the observed reduction in GHG 
emission intensity. 

Additionally, several external factors might be influencing this 
reduction. Stricter international regulations on GHG emissions from 
shipping are pushing the industry towards more efficient operations. 
Technological advancements in marine propulsion systems, hull 
designs, and fuel types contribute to lower emissions. Economic 
factors, such as fluctuations in fuel prices, can incentivize more 
fuel-efficient practices and technologies. Environmental awareness 
and corporate responsibility pressures from stakeholders, including 
investors and customers, are driving shipping companies to focus 
more on reducing their carbon footprint. Collaborative efforts within 
the maritime industry to reduce emissions and improve efficiency, 
such as data sharing and joint development projects, also play a 
significant role. 

In summary, the decrease in fleetwide average GHG emission 
intensity in 2023 compared to 2022 results from improved fleet 
operations, technological enhancements, supply chain stabilization, 
and efficient capacity utilization. External factors such as regulatory 
changes, technological advances, economic considerations, 
increased environmental awareness, and collaborative industry 
efforts contribute to this positive trend.
