1. Purpose of this document: 

The purpose of this crosswalk document is to outline and explain the changes made to the  GLEC 
Framework between versions v3.1 (October 2024) and v3.0 (September 2023). It serves as a guide 
to  help  users  of  the  Framework  understand  how  the  new  version  differs  from  the  previous  one, 
ensuring a smooth transition to the updated guidelines. 

2. Objectives: 

•  Mapping  Changes:  The  document  will  provide  a  comparison  between  the  two  versions, 
identifying specific sections that have been updated, removed, or added. This allows users to 
quickly identify what has changed without needing to review the entire framework. 

•  Clarifying  Updates:  For  each  change,  the  crosswalk  document  will  offer  explanations  or 
justifications  for  why  these  updates  were  made,  e.g.  due  to  technological  advancements, 
regulatory shifts, or user feedback. 

•  Ensuring Compliance: Stakeholders who rely on the  GLEC Framework for environmental 
reporting  can  use  the  crosswalk  document  to ensure  they  remain  compliant  with  the latest 
standards.

Updated figures for transport demand prediction, and 
the prediction of logistics emission contributed per 
transport mode in 2050 (big infographic). The update is 
based on International Transport Forum Outlook 2023 
report 

Added to refer the readers to the last page of change 
overview table for the summary of v3.1 updates 

Update the description of Scope 3 emissions to be 
more accurate 

Updates on table 1. Overview of emissions accounting 
and reporting methods which are harmonized in the 
GLEC Framework. As we are using updated standards 
for Hubs and Rail. 

Typo correction in the infographic 

The reference page was updated with new sources 
used in this revision. The hyperlinks of the old sources 
are also reviewed and give new access date. 

Correction on the definition of scope 3 category 8 & 13 
in the info box: additional reporting requirements by 
other standards 

Updated text in the paragraph for Data Exchange and 
Assurance, following the evolving work in SFC projects 
and the SFC Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS). 

The hyperlinks of the sources have been reviewed and 
given new access date. 

We included the biogenic GHG emissions operational 
values for the bio-based fuels (in multiple tables) as 
required for complete Scope 3 reporting under the 
GHG Protocol. 

Update the values in these emission factors table 
following the updated data source: GREET 2023 & 
EcoTransIT methodology 2024 

New content and emission factor table incorporated 
from the China Default GHG Emission Values report 
V1.0 (SFC,2024)

New content and emission factors table source from 
IMO MEPC 81, Infras & Fraunhofer, EcoTransIT 
World: Environmental Methodology and Data (2024), 
Fuel.EU Maritime amended & RED II 

The air fuel emission factor was originally provided 
separately in the European and North American table. 
With this update, we are separating it as an individual 
table and section by recognizing the need to realign 
emission factors across the GLEC Framework and the 
IATA recommended practices. With this update, we 
wish to provide a single set of emission factors for use 
irrespective of geographic difference 

Additional paragraph to introduce the new data source 
of IMO MEPC 81 

Expanded the number of tables from 1 to 6, to cover 
the blending options for gasoline/ethanol, 
diesel/ethanol, diesel/HVO in both Europe and North 
America 

The scaling factor table was updated and divided into 
2 tables to give separate indication for European and 
North American value.

Module 2 

Default fuel efficiency and GHG emission intensity values 

-  Distance uplift factor  

4 

An uplift to the relevant emission intensity values has 
been included in the GLEC Framework v3.1 to account 
'Out of route trips and deviations' equating to the 
Distance Adjustment Factor (DAF) between the SFD 
and GCD (for air) and the actual distance. These apply 
to Air, Road and Sea.

We have changed the electricity emission factor 
source from IEA global electricity factors (2022) to the 
latest EcoTransIT technical update and used the 
railway-specific values, to get closer to the full life-
cycle approach recommended by ISO 14083. 
We added a new sentence to give directions on the 
uplift for temperature-controlled Rail Freight. 

Updated the emission intensity table for both North 
America and Europe 
Added a new table for China road emission intensity 
value sourced from the China Default GHG Emission 
Values report V1.0 (SFC,2024) 
Deleted the reference of boarder scope specific data
