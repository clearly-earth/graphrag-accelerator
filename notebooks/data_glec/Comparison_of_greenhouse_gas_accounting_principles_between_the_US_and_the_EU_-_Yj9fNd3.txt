Executive Summary 

Low-carbon and sustainable biofuels can play a short term role in decarbonizing the road freight 
sector,  where  zero  emission  technology  is  not  yet  readily  available.  It  can  act  as  a  short  term 
drop-in  fuel  to  electric  and  fuel  cell  vehicles,  especially  as  these  technologies  and  markets 
continue to mature. However, understanding the extent to which these biofuels can reduce GHG 
emissions on a lifecycle basis is a challenge due to the wide variety of feedstock supply chains 
and  use  cases,  as  well  as  different  methodologies  for  emission  accounting  in  the  biofuel 
production sector.  
Due  to  the  complexity  of  biofuel  greenhouse  gas  lifecycle  assessment,  it  is  vital  to  provide 
transparency into the process of incorporating emission factors from  any existing database into 
the set of default factors provided in the Global Logistics Emission Council (GLEC) Framework. 
This ensures that the necessary steps towards harmonization of emission factor assumptions are 
taken,  providing  a  consistent  approach  across  different  emission  database  sources  and 
geographical regions. 
The Comparison of greenhouse gas accounting principles between the US and the EU report is 
part of Smart Freight Centre’s series on low and zero emission fuels, where we address different 
implementation  challenges  of  biofuels  as  a

decarbonization solution. The full series is available here. 

impact,  emissions  and 

This report analyzes the development of US biofuel emission factors in the Greenhouse gases, 
Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model developed by Argonne 
National Laboratory with the following aims: 
▪  Provide visibility into the development of emission factors in the GREET 1 database, which 
focuses on the  fuel  lifecycle analysis, specifically  in terms of database structure, emission 
categories, and calculation approach.  

▪  Provide recommendations on emission factor values to be used for North American biofuels 

in the GLEC Framework 

▪  Provide recommendations for harmonization of US and Europe emission factor calculation 
approaches and accounting principles, in terms of feedstocks, production pathways, emission 
categories, and separate categories for emissions from land-use change and indirect land-
use change. 

For  comparison,  the  EU  emission  factor  sources  are  taken  from  Annex  V  of  the  Renewable 
Energy Directive II (RED II) and the JEC Well-to-Wheels report v5 (JECv5). Both sources have 
been  used  to  define  the  biofuel  emission  factors  used  in  GLEC  Framework,  and  have  been 
analyzed in Smart Freight Centre’s Desktop Review of GHG Emission Factors for Road Freight 
and ifeu work on the EcoTransIT World-Environmental Methodology and Data report referenced 
in ISO 14083.  
The fuels studied are petroleum-, natural gas-derived fuels, and their biofuel replacements: 
▪  Gasoline 
▪  Diesel 
▪  Liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
▪  Bioethanol 
▪  Biodiesel 
▪  Renewable diesel 
▪  Liquefied biomethane (LBM) 
Database structure 
The  GREET  model  includes  more  than  100  fuel  production  pathways/energy  systems  from 
various energy feedstock sources, though not all at the same level of detail and some have been 
updated more recently than others. The most important biofuel production pathways are: 

5 

    
 
 
 
Comparison  of  greenhouse  gas  accounting 
principles between the US and the EU 

▪  Ethanol produced from food crops, such as corn, corn stover, and sugarcane.  
▪  Biodiesel  produced  from  oilseed  crops,  such  as  soybean  and  rapeseed,  as  well  as  from 
waste-based feedstock, such as used (waste) cooking oil, distillers corn oil, and animal fats. 
▪  Renewable  diesel  (HVO  in  Europe)  produced  from  oilseed  crops,  such  as  soybean  and 

rapeseed, as well as waste feedstock such as animal fats.  

▪  Liquefied biomethane. 
As such, there is significant coverage of different types of fuels between GREET 1 and the biofuel 
production pathways covered in the JEC WTW v5 and RED II. The key difference is that GREET 
predominantly  includes  the  production  of  renewable  diesel  also  known  as  HVO  in  Europe,  via 
other processes besides hydrogenation, such as gasification, pyrolysis and other biochemical and 
thermochemical  technologies.  RED  II  partly  covers  other  processes  for  renewable  diesel 
excluding  HVO.  Another key difference is that the  emission factor  of waste-derived renewable 
natural  gas  in  GREET  is  much  lower  than  their  European  counterparts  due  to  high  emission 
credits from avoided emissions. 

Emission categories  
The  GREET  model  includes  a  module  for  estimating  land  use  and  land  management  change 
emissions  using  the  Carbon  Calculator  for  Land  Use  and  Land  Management  Change  from 
Biofuels Production (CCLUB) and the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). According to RED 
II, direct land use change emissions are to be included in the emission factor calculation, but in 
Europe  it  does  not  occur  anymore  since  it  is  not  feasible  to  convert  land  to  land  for  biofuel 
production as this would lead to GHG emissions above the threshold set in RED II. Indirect land 
use  change  (iLUC)  emissions  are  not  included  in  RED  II  GHG  values  because  of  the  high 
uncertainty in the values provided, however, RED II is limiting the use of biofuels with a high risk 
of iLUC (e.g. palm oil) and looking to phase out these feedstocks in near future. As an example 
of comparing iLUC values for biodiesel from soybean, the GREET value is 9 g CO2e/MJ  while in 
the RED II has 55 gCO2e/MJ. This is due to the fact that iLUC can vary considerably across biofuel 
pathways, mainly contingent on technologies and feedstocks, and iLUC emissions are uncertain 
and sensitive to modeling parameters and assumptions.  
GREET takes into account methane slip for the biomethane emission factor, which is not explicitly 
addressed in the European databases. Nevertheless, a recent Smart Freight Centre analysis in 
‘The Potential of Bio-LNG in Decarbonizing Logistics’ Whitepaper addressed and estimated the 
amount of methane slip emissions in liquefied biomethane.  
Other  challenges  that  require  harmonization  include  issues  surrounding  the  use  of  avoided 
emissions, biogenic and industrial removals, and credit schemes. 

Recommendations 
The  following  recommendations  for  further  research  will  help  harmonize  the  approaches  for 
emission factor development in the Europe and the US. 
▪  Develop common consensus to address the (i) inclusion of methane slip, and (ii) allocation of 
avoided  emissions  in  GHG  accounting  principles  for  the  end-users  to  have  a  universal 
accounting and reporting structure. 

▪  Develop principles to take into account when developing emission factors for GHG emission 
reporting, in particular as emission factors are evolving over time due to the introduction of 
new energy carriers, the available technology for the production of fuels improves, and lower 
emission energy sources are deployed to power production processes.  

▪  Review  how  iLUC  emissions  can  be  estimated  with  greater  reliability,  such  that  it  can  be 

included in freight emissions reporting and the GLEC Framework emission factors. 

Future  work  will  include  reviewing  the  availability  of  synthetic  and  e-fuels  in  the  market  and 
importance to be included in the GLEC Framework.

1  Introduction 

The Comparison of greenhouse gas accounting principles between the US and the EU report is 
part  of  Smart  Freight  Centre’s  series  on  biofuels,  where  we  address  different  perspectives  on 
impact, emissions and implementation challenges of biofuels as a decarbonization solution. The 
full series is available here. 

A quick transition to low or zero-emission fuels and vehicle technology is essential to meet the 
goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change in the freight and logistics sector. The road freight 
sector  accounts  for  over  10%  of  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  these  emissions  are 
increasing (E. & I. S. Department for Business, 2022). In the US, 36% of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in 2020 came from the transport sector, of which 17% are due to light-duty vehicles 
and  26  %  due  to  medium-  to  heavy-duty  vehicles.  This  is  largely  due  to  the  almost  exclusive 
reliance  on  petroleum-derived  liquid  fuels  (e.g.,  gasoline  and  diesel)  as  an  energy  source 
(Environmental Protection Agency, 2022).  
Low-carbon and sustainable biofuels can play a role in decarbonizing the freight sector alongside 
other technologies, such as electric and fuel cell vehicles, especially as these technologies and 
markets continue to mature (N. Gray et al., 2021) (R. Chen et al., 2018). However, understanding 
the extent to which these biofuels can reduce emissions is a challenge with the wide variety of 
feedstock supply chains and uses, as well as different methodologies for emission accounting in 
the biofuel production sector. 
The  Smart  Freight  Centre  supports  companies  in  emission  reduction  related  to  their  freight 
transport,  through  the  Global  Logistics  Emission  Council  (GLEC)  Framework,  the  industry’s 
standard methodology for tracking freight GHG emissions. Part of the ongoing development work 
of the GLEC Framework is the identification and review of reliable  GHG emission factors from 
lifecycle emission factor databases established in different transport markets.  

1.1  GHG emission factors  

A  GHG  emission  factor  indicates  the  mass  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  (CO2e)  released  for  a 
quantity of fuel or electricity used. The GLEC Framework uses full fuel lifecycle emission factors, 
i.e., covering emissions produced in both Well-to-Tank (WTT) and Tank-to-Wheel (TTW) phases. 
WTT emissions consist of emissions during the fuel production and distribution, while the TTW 
emissions consist of emissions  from the combustion of fuel (Smart Freight Centre, 2019). The 
GLEC Framework provides default emission factors for a wide variety of fuels, which are based 
on representative and reasonable estimates for a specific area (e.g., the EU or North America). 
These default emission factors are often used in place of certified emission factors specific to a 
fuel  batch,  when  they  are  unavailable,  and  thus  play  an  important  role  in  emission  disclosure 
practices. 
For  biofuels,  the  carbon-based  emissions  (i.e.,  carbon  dioxide,  carbon  monoxide  and  volatile 
organic compounds) in the TTW phase is designated zero, as it is assumed that an equivalent 
amount  of  carbon  dioxide  is  sequestered  from  the  atmosphere  as  the  biomass  grew,  whether 
from agriculture or naturally. This means that a major component of the lifecycle emissions comes 
the WTT phase, that is from the agricultural and industrial activity. Biofuel WTT emissions strongly 
depend  on  the  type  of  feedstock  used  and  the  production  pathways,  which  in  this  flourishing 
sector, keep diversifying. Further, regional practices adopted by emission factor databases may 
allow  for  various  ways  to  deal  with  different  emission  categories,  notably  carbon  or  manure 
credits, induced or indirect land use change.  
Due  to  the  complexity  of  biofuel  greenhouse  gas  lifecycle  assessment,  it  is  vital  to  provide 
transparency into the process of incorporating emission factors from any existing database into 
the set of default factors provided in the Global Logistics Emission Council (GLEC) Framework. 
This ensures that the necessary steps towards harmonization of emission factor assumptions are

taken,  providing  a  consistent  approach  across  different  emission  database  sources  and 
geographical regions. 

1.2  Objectives and scope 

This report addresses a critical absence in the GLEC Framework, namely North American biofuel 
emission factors. Specifically, the report will address the following: 
▪  Provide visibility into the development of emission factors in the selected US-based lifecycle 
emissions factor database, specifically in terms of database structure, emission categories, 
and calculation approach.  

▪  Provide recommendations on emissions factor values to be used for North American biofuels 

in the GLEC framework 

▪  Provide recommendations for harmonization  of US and Europe emission factor calculation 
approaches and accounting principles, in terms of feedstocks, production pathways, emission 
categories, and separate categories for emissions from direct and indirect land-use change. 
The study uses the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies 
(GREET)  model,  developed  by  Argonne  National  Laboratory  with  funding  from  the  U.S. 
Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [13], which is 
viewed as the de facto standard when it comes to transport lifecycle emission factors in the US. 
For  comparison,  the  EU  emission  factor  sources  are  taken  from  Annex  V  of  the  Renewable 
Energy Directive (recast) (RED II) and the JEC Well-to-Wheels report v5 (JECv5). Both sources 
have been used to define the biofuel emission factors used in the GLEC Framework and ifeu work 
on EcoTransIT World-Environmental Methodology and Data report included in ISO 14083.  
The fuels studied are petroleum-, natural gas-derived fuels, and their biofuel replacements: 
▪  Gasoline 
▪  Diesel 
▪  Liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
▪  Bioethanol 
▪  Biodiesel 
▪  Renewable diesel 
▪  Liquefied biomethane (LBM) 

1.3  Report structure 

The structure of the report is as follows. Section 2 presents the analysis of the GREET model 
structure. Section 3 presents the analysis of methodology resulting in a list of adaptations needed 
to  be  harmonized  with  the  GLEC  Framework.  Section  4  presents  the  results  of  adapting  the 
GREET  model  emission  factors  for  biofuels  and  comparing  it  with  the  European  values.  This 
section also presents insights into the differences between the values of fuels used in the US and 
the EU. Section 5 concludes with highlighting several steps to take to increase harmonization of 
emission factor work for biofuels and emerging fuel types.

2  Analysis of the GREET model structure 

This section presents an overview of the GREET model  by way of clarifying the tool’s general 
structures, the units used and vehicle types, as well as its scope, with respect to biofuel production 
pathways, emission categories, emissions from land-use and land management change, indirect 
land use change (iLUC) and methane slip. 

2.1  Overview of the GREET tool 

The  GREET  model  (H.  Kwon  and  U.  Lee,  2019)  is  an  analytical  tool  and  hybrid  model  that 
simulates  the  energy  use  and  emission  output  of  various  vehicle  and  fuel  combinations.  The 
GREET  model  is  utilized  by  more  than  45,000  users  around  the  world  including  government 
agencies, national labs, universities and industry. It is also an integral part of transportation and 
bioenergy  technology  evaluation.  GREET  plays  a  valuable  role  in  the  identification  of 
opportunities for improving the sustainability of technologies,  promoting the clean and efficient 
vehicle and fuel technologies, and informing policies through high-quality, consistent and peer-
reviewed analyses and publications. 
In  GREET,  the  process  is  primarily  based  on  the  attributional  lifecycle  assessment  (LCA) 
approach, while land-use change is essentially  based on the consequential approach. GREET 
includes all transport subsectors such as road, air, rail and marine and in the current version of 
2021 also includes LCA of buildings and building technologies. GREET can be accessed using 
two platforms: the GREET Excel model and the GREET.net model. 
GREET Excel provides a comprehensive lifecycle-based approach to comparing the energy use 
and  emissions of conventional and advanced vehicle technologies. It consists of two  separate 
excel sheets: 
▪  GREET 1 presents the lifecycle analysis of the transport fuel, encompassing the fuel cycle, 

that is the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel emissions.    

▪  GREET  2 presents the lifecycle analysis of the vehicle and provides energy  and emission 
effects  associated  with  vehicle  material  recovery  and  production,  vehicle  component 
fabrication, vehicle assembly, and vehicle disposal or recycling.  

GREET.net  provides  a  more  user-friendly  graphical  interface  to  perform  lifecycle  analysis 
simulations of alternative transportation fuels and vehicle technologies and makes use GREET1 
and GREET2 Excel models.  

2.2  Units used as inputs and outputs 

The GREET model has various functional units depending on the services (e.g. mile, tonne-mile, 
tonne-km, passenger-mile), outputs (e.g. MMBtu, MJ, gasoline gallon equivalent), and resources 
(e.g. per tonne of biomass) (Argonne National Laboratory, 2021) (ibid). The interface allows the 
user to quickly convert the units from one to another.  
The values reported in this report are based on SI units (i.e. g CO2eq/MJ).  

2.3  Vehicle type 

GREET  includes  more  than  80  on-road  powertrain/fuel  systems  for  both  light-duty  and  heavy-
duty vehicles (M. Wang, 2021). Table 1 provides an overview of the engine type and respective 
fuel use in the GREET model. The fuel reported is based on the utilization in the class 7/8 trucks 
i.e., heavy-duty vehicles that are mostly used for road freight in the U.S.

2.4  Fuel production pathways  

The  GREET  model  includes  more  than  100  fuel  production  pathways/energy  systems  from 
various energy feedstock sources (Figure 1), though not all at the same level of detail and some 
have been updated more recently than others.  
These include: 
▪ 
▪  hydrogen  produced  from  fossil  fuels,  biomass,  electricity  and  nuclear  energy,  as  well  as 

conventional fuels derived from fossil fuels, such as petroleum and natural gas,  

including carbon capture system  

▪  electricity produced from fossil fuels, biomass, renewable power plants and nuclear energy, 

as well as including CCS 

▪  biofuels 
▪  e-fuels produced from renewable hydrogen and CO2 sources. 

Figure 1 Fuel production pathways included in the GREET mode (adapted) (M. Wang, 2021) 

GREET  includes  various  possible  feedstocks  and  conversion  technologies  for  production  of 
biofuels  as  depicted  in  Figure  2.  These  production  methods  are  described  extensively  in  the 
GREET model.

Figure 2 Detailed production pathways of biofuels in the GREET model (adapted) (H. Kwon and 
U. Lee, 2019) 

For  the  purpose  of  this  report,  i.e.,  for  potential  inclusion  in  the  GLEC  Framework,  only  major 
production pathways are analyzed. These are based on feedstocks that are prominent in the US 
market,  as  well  as  those  which  fall  under  the  Low  Carbon  Fuel  Standard  (LCFS)  and  the 
Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).  
▪  Ethanol produced from food crops, such as corn, corn stover, and sugarcane.  
▪  Biodiesel produced from oilseed crops, such as soybean and rapeseed, as well from waste-

based feedstock, such as waste cooking oil, corn oil, and animal fats.  

▪  Renewable diesel produced from oilseed crops, such as soybean and rapeseed, as well as 

waste feedstock i.e., animal fats.  

▪  Liquefied biomethane produced from landfill gas and wet manure. 

2.5  Energy and Environmental Metrics 

The  model  sustainability  metric  includes  energy  use  (fossil  and  renewable),  and  air  pollutants 
(such as VOC, CO, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, BC, OC, and SOx) which are estimated separately for total 
and urban, greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) combined with their global warming potentials, 
and water consumption (Argonne National Laboratory, 2021) (ibid). Land-use change and indirect 
land-use change along with methane leakage is also addressed as it is mostly associated with 
the storage and transportation of volatile fuels. 

Land-use change and land management change 
Direct  land-use  change  refers  to  a  process  in  which  human  activities  transform  the  natural 
landscape  for  economic  activities  e.g.,  from  forest  to  farmland  to  produce  crops  for  biofuels. 
Human  activities  which  affect  terrestrial  sinks  with  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry 
(LULUCF) activities, alter the exchange of CO2 (carbon cycle) between the terrestrial biosphere 
system and the atmosphere (UNFCCC, 2017). The changes in land use, as well as management 
processes, have a massive impact on the soil ecosystems and in turn, can affect key soil functions 
(D. J. Spurgeon, 2013).  
The Carbon Calculator for Land Use and Land Management Change from Biofuels Production 
(CCLUB) (H. Kwon, 2021) from the GREET model is used for analyzing the GHG emissions from

land-use  change  (LUC)  and  land  management  change  (LMC)  in  the  biofuel  life  cycle  analysis 
(LCA). The values are expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per MJ of fuel produced.  
The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) developed by Purdue University is used to estimate 
the domestic area (US) and international land areas such as forest, grassland, cropland pasture, 
and feedstock lands that transitions to another land type at the agro-ecological zone(AEZ), which 
is  multiplied  by  corresponding  emission  factors  (EF)  aggregated/disaggregated  from  different 
spatial coverages, to estimate LUC GHG emissions for biofuel production scenarios (Figure 3).  

Figure 3 Schematics of land use change in GREET (ibid) 

Indirect land-use change 
Crop-based biofuel production may cause indirect land-use change (iLUC) emissions (Z. Qin and 
H. Kwon, 2018). iLUC refers to the indirect carbon emissions that would be expected to occur due 
to  diverting  (crop-based)  feedstocks  from  their  current  use  or  purpose  to  the  production  of 
biofuels. This relates to the fact that consumption of a feedstock to produce biofuels results in a 
constraint on the availability of that feedstock for use in other purposes (e.g., food production). 
This  leads  to  an  expansion  in  its  production  to  meet  market  needs.  Where  this  increase  in 
production leads to the clearing of and/or cultivation of additional land, this can result in a loss of 
carbon storage capacity (e.g., due to the felling of the forest) causing additional carbon emissions. 
These emissions are attributable to the action that caused them (i.e., the production of crop-based 
biofuels) to provide a complete system picture of the greenhouse gas profile of biofuels produced 
from different feedstocks.  
In the GREET Model, the iLUC emissions are calculated with the use of models that decide the 
area  changes  of  specific  land  types  and  EFs  for  conversion  of  one  land  type  to  another.  The 
factors responsible for iLUC emission calculations are (ibid):  
▪ 
▪ 

the area of land that transits from one type of land use to another; and,  
the EFs that determine specific (i.e., CO2, N2O, and CH4) or total GHG emissions per unit 
area changed associated with specific iLUC. 

When  it  comes  to  calculation  of  indirect  land-use  change  values,  it  is  not  easy  (essentially 
impossible) to determine who causes indirect land-use change and to separate it from direct land-
use  change.    Without  common  standards  for  the  treatment  of  different  land  use  emission 
scenarios this leads to wide variability of outputs.  For example, in the case of biodiesel soybean, 
the  iLUC  value  from  GREET  is  9  g  CO2e/MJ  whereas  from  RED  II  the  equivalent  value  is  55 

13 

    
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparison  of  greenhouse  gas  accounting 
principles between the US and the EU 

gCO2e/MJ.  Thus,  bearing  this  uncertainty  in  mind,  the  addition  of  the  iLUC  contribution  to  the 
lifecycle  emissions  has  been  shown  to  outweigh  the  benefits  of  using  some  potential  biofuel 
feedstocks, especially soy and palm oil in Europe and the implementation of the RED II directive 
has restricted the amount of biofuel production from traditional crop-based feedstock to limit the 
impact of indirect land-use change emissions.  
Therefore,  to  be  compatible  with  the  European  values  and  the  new  ISO  14083,  iLUC  is  not 
included into the GHG emission factors but given separately. 

Methane Slip 
Over  the  years  there  has  been  much  debate  about  the  potential  benefits  of  gaseous  fuels, 
particularly  natural  gas,  as  part  of  the  energy  transition  to  a  low-carbon  transport  sector.  The 
debate arises because  methane  is both volatile  and  a strong greenhouse gas, meaning that it 
does not take much leakage to negate any benefit from the theoretical benefits that might result 
from full combustion of what is potentially a more energy-efficient fuel.  
The scope of this study does not include an in-depth discussion of this issue. Initial comparison 
of GREET with European databases has concluded that GREET takes methane slip into account, 
whereas many of the European databases do not, limiting their analysis to an assumption of full 
combustion. Nevertheless, a recent Smart Freight Centre analysis in ‘The Potential of Bio-LNG 
in  Decarbonizing  Logistics’  Whitepaper  addressed  and  estimated  the  amount  of  methane  slip 
emissions  in  liquefied  biomethane,  and  also  included  in  the  recent  update  of  the  GLEC 
Framework.

3  Methodology  

3.1  Database development 

The GREET database builds upon past iterations of its life-cycle inventory datasets and additional 
data  sets  that  are  compiled  from  industrial  surveys,  government  databases,  other  national 
laboratories’  databases  and  literature.  For  baseline  technologies  and  systems,  the  values  are 
taken from Energy Information Administration (EIA) data and annual energy outlook projections, 
for electric systems U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) eGrid, and water US geology 
services  (M.  Wang,  2021).  The  farming  data  from  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture 
(USDA), energy use from ethanol plants, and operational data from oil sands and shale oil are 
used as underlying data for the field operation (H. Xu et al., 2022) (A. Elgowainy, 2019) (H. Kwon 
and U. Lee, 2019).  
For certain fuel production such as renewable diesel datasets, a simulation model such  as the  
ASPEN plus model is used. As for fuel economy calculations, data is collected from the Argonne 
National Laboratory (ANL) Autonomie database, whereas the data sets for LUC and iLUC values 
are taken from the CCLUB model (M. Wang, 2021), (H. Kwon, 2021). In the case of vehicular 
emission calculation, the values are based on EPA Moves and EPA AMPD (stationary) (M. Wang, 
2021).  For  data  for  petroleum  refinery  operations,  linear  programming  models  are  used,  while 
electricity utility dispatch models are used for marginal electricity analysis (A. Elgowainy, 2019). 
The  inputs  from  industrial  surveys  are  used  for  the  data  collection  on  fuel  producers  and 
technology developers with the automakers and system components producers on vehicles (H. 
Kwon and U. Lee, 2019) (A. Elgowainy, 2019), (Argonne National Laboratory, 2014).  
ANL  collected  datasets  for  major  biodiesel  and  renewable  diesel  pathways  through  industrial 
surveys with the support of the National Biodiesel Board (NBB) and the North American Renders 
Association (NARA) (H. Xu et al., 2022).  

3.2  Calculation approach 

combustion of fuels for heat and energy for the process, and  
leakage through the storage and transportation of volatile fuels.  

In GREET, life cycle calculation has several stages such as end-use, transportation, distribution, 
and production, and each stage is represented as a stationary or transportation process (Argonne 
National Laboratory, 2014). Within each process step, the emission is emitted through  
▪ 
▪ 
In the result overview, emission factors (EF) are broken down into feedstock, fuels, and vehicle 
operations.  
The flow of the calculation in the GREET model is shown in  Figure 4: energy input accounting 
to a process is done based on a list of resources, associated amounts and leakage rates(Argonne 
National  Laboratory,  2021).  For  process  emissions  accounting,  notion  of  technology  is  used, 
where technology is an abstraction defined by a set of emission factors for each of the criteria 
pollutants. The resources used in a process can be allocated to one or more technologies and 
then the entire life cycle is modelled once processes are combined into pathways (ibid).  
All the resources and technologies used in the process of a pathway are combined to calculate 
the energy and emissions associated with each pathway which has a single main product. The 
energy  and  emissions  of  a  pathway  that  are  calculated  are  used  as  upstream  values  for  the 
corresponding product in the case of being used as an input to any process within the model. The 
circular references are resolved through iterative calculations. An input-output model is used for 
each stage process within the fuel production pathway.

In GREET, calculation is  based upon: 
▪  energy consumption including total energy (energy in non-renewable and renewable sources) 

and fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal),  

▪  water consumption,  
▪  greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and  
▪  air  pollutant  emissions  including  volatile  organic  compounds,  carbon  monoxide,  nitrogen 
oxides, particulate matter with different sizes (Argonne National Laboratory, 2021), (Argonne 
National Laboratory, 2014).  

Allocation methods are based on mass, energy content, market prices or resolved via a system 
expansion and used to assign impacts and benefits to multiple co-products of the same process 
or from various systems providing multiple functions, e.g., products and waste management. 

3.3  Fuel Description 

3.3.1  Ethanol 

In the U.S., ethanol has accounted for more than 10% of the gasoline market share in 2019 due 
to blending, during which corn ethanol production has increased from 6.1 billion liters in 2000 to 
57 billion liters in 2019 (U. Lee et al., 2021) This is further encouraged by biofuel policies like US 
Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  (EPA’s)  Renewable  Fuel  Standard  (RFS)  and  California’s 
Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) (ibid).  
The system boundaries for ethanol are similar for different feedstocks such as sugarcane, corn 
stover,  miscanthus  etc.  To  provide  an  idea  of  the  system  boundaries,  corn-based  ethanol  is 
shown in Figure 5, and consists of four major stages, namely farming, ethanol production, ethanol 
transportation and distribution (T&D), and ethanol combustion.   
All  the  GHG  emissions  i.e.,  CO2,  CH4  and  N2O  are  accounted  for  in  each  stage  as  well  as 
upstream  emissions  of  inputs  to  each  stage  (e.g.,  electricity,  natural  gas,  fertilizer,  etc.).  The 
ethanol combustion stage accounts for ethanol combustion emissions during vehicle operations, 
the CO2 emissions from ethanol combustion are offset by uptake of CO2 during corn plant growth, 
meaning that biogenic CO2 emissions from combustion are considered carbon neutral.  
Ethanol production has significantly evolved during the past two decades mostly due to increase 
in  both  corn  farming  and  biorefineries.  Corn  yield  per  hectare  has  grown  continuously  while 
chemical inputs per hectare remain constant leading to a decrease in fertilizer intensities per corn 
harvest. In addition, increased corn grain ethanol yield and reductions in energy use have reduced 
the  life-cycle  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  per  megajoule  (MJ)  of  corn  grain  ethanol

produced  and  used.  In  2014,  the  carbon  intensity  of  corn  ethanol  was  estimated  to  be  65.5 
gCO2e/MJ,  including  LUC  GHG  emissions  of  9.0  gCO2e/MJ,  while  the  calculated  CI  of  corn 
ethanol is 53.2 gCO2e/MJ (including LUC GHG emissions of 7.4 gCO2e/MJ) in 2020 (U. Lee et 
al., 2021).

3.3.2  Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel 

In  the  U.S.,  two  major  types  of  biomass-derived  diesel  are  available  in  the  market,  including 
biodiesel  (fatty  acid  methyl  ester  biodiesel)  and  hydrogenation-derived  renewable  diesel  (RD). 
Biodiesel (BD) is produced via the transesterification process, whereas renewable diesel (RD) is 
produced using the catalytic hydro-processing method. 
The system boundary shown in Figure 6 provides information on biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) 
and  Renewable  diesel  (hydro  processed  esters  and  fatty  acids)  pathways  produced  from 
vegetable oil from oilseed crops (soybean, rapeseed/canola, carinata (aka Ethiopian mustard)) 
and  low-value  feedstocks  (inedible  beef-tallow,  Distillers  corn  oil  (DCO),  and  used  cooking  oil 
(UCO)). For oilseed crops, key stages include biomass production (i.e., farming), oilseed crushing 
and oil extraction, biofuel conversion, and fuel distribution and consumption. In the case of tallow 
and UCO pathways, key stages are grease/oil rendering, biofuel conversion, and fuel distribution 
and consumption. Within all waste-based pathways for BD and RD, the most prominent feedstock, 
inedible beef tallow which is a recovered by-product from the meat production process does not 
share upstream emissions (e.g., livestock cultivation).  
GHG emission reductions from producing biodiesel and renewable diesel from soybean, canola 
(rapeseed), and carinata oils range from 40% to 69% including land-use change estimations when 
compared with petroleum diesel. In comparison, the waste feedstocks such as animal fats, used 
cooking oil, and distillers corn oil to biodiesel and renewable diesel could achieve greater WTW 
GHG reductions of 79% to 86% compared to fossil diesel  (H. Xu et al., 2022), (B. Riazi, 2020), 
(R. Chen et al., 2017-2018). The key factors driving biodiesel and renewable diesel lifecycle GHG 
emissions consist of land-use change, allocation methods influencing the values, fertilizer use, 
nitrous  oxide  used  in  crop  farming,  energy  inputs  to  grease  rendering  and  the  energy  and 
chemical inputs for biofuel conversion (H. Xu et al., 2022). 

Figure 6 System boundaries for biodiesel and renewable diesel pathway (adapted) (H. Xu et al., 
2022) 

For oilseed feedstock-based biodiesel, the GHG emissions are lower than for the RD route as the 
transesterification  process  is  less  energy-intensive  than  hydro-processing.  On  the  other  hand, 
animal waste biodiesel has slightly higher emissions than the RD from animal fats due to higher 
energy  use  for  pre-treatment  (ibid).  The  process  level  hybrid  allocation  method  is  used  for 
attributing the energy use and emissions to the various products ranging from oilseed crushing, 
animal  fat  rendering  and  biofuel  conversion.  A  mass  based  allocation  is  used  for  both  oilseed 
crushing and animal fat rendering due to oilseed meals and MBM having protein or feed products 

18 

    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparison  of  greenhouse  gas  accounting

rather than energy products. An alternative allocation method based on market based allocation 
was  also  applied  to  both  oilseed  crushing  and  animal  fat  rendering  to  check  the  sensitivity  of 
results for a different coproduct allocation method. For renewable diesel production, the energy 
based allocation method was used because co products from hydro processing- fuel gas, LPG, 
and naphtha are energy based products. For biodiesel production, market based allocation was 
used as the co product glycerin from the transesterification process is not an energy product.  

In  the  U.S.,  the  production  and  consumption  of  biomass-derived  diesel  have  been  expanding 
steadily in the past decade. Biodiesel production has increased from 1.3 billion liters a year to 
more than 7.1 billion liters in 2020 (ibid), (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022) guided 
primarily by U.S. biofuel policies such as Renewable Fuel Standard and California Low-Carbon 
Fuel Standard. 

3.3.3  Liquified Biomethane (Bio-LNG) 

In the US, between 8 and 77 million dry tons of sludge is generated from wastewater treatment 
plants (WWTP) and municipal solid waste (MSW) (EPA, 2006) (U. Lee et al., 2016). Sludge, which 
is commonly treated in Anaerobic Digesters (AD), produces biogas that is largely flared to reduce 
methane emissions. Sludge has a homogeneous characteristic and high energy content and can 
be  used  as  a  potential  feedstock  for  conversion  processes  to  produce  renewable  natural  gas 
(RNG),  which  can  be  further  processed  to  produce  compressed  biomethane  (Bio-CNG)  and 
liquified  biomethane  (Bio-LNG)  (ibid).  When  compared  to  gasoline  and  diesel,  the  sludge  to 
renewable natural gas via anaerobic digestion leads to WTW GHG emission reduction between 
39% to 80%. These reductions are due to GHG credits  within  the fuel  LCA based on  avoided 
GHG emissions under the counterfactual scenario, and/or fertilizer displacement credits(ibid). 
As shown in Figure 7, in the system boundaries, the alternative AD case utilizes biogas for energy 
recovery instead of flaring it as in the counterfactual scenario. There are also other processes 
(e.g.,  sludge  collection,  digestate  storage,  dewatering,  and  disposal)  included  as  in  the 
counterfactual scenario. After the first cleanup process, the alternative AD generates heat and 
power in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) by burning biogas. The heat generated from CHP via 
a boiler is used to meet the onsite thermal demand, while the electricity from CHP can be used 
to meet the onsite electricity demand and exported if there is an excess). The rest of the cleaned 
biogas  is  further  processed  (second  cleanup)  to  produce  pipeline-quality  RNG.  RNG  is  then 
transmitted to refueling stations via pipeline, compressed, and used as compressed biomethane 
(Bio-CNG) and liquified biomethane (Bio-LNG) (U. Environmental Protection Agency, 2018), (U. 
Lee et al., 2016). 

Figure  7  System  boundary  for  wastewater  sludge-based  Bio-CNG  and  Bio-LNG  via  anaerobic 
digestion (adapted) (U. Lee et al., 2016) 
The well-to-wheel values for Bio-LNG produced from MSW or sewage sludge are negative due 
to avoided landfill emission (mainly CH4), which has 30 times the global warming potential (GWP) 
of CO2, thus resulting in carbon credits for the avoided emissions (U. Lee et al., 2021) In GREET, 
the carbon intensities of waste derived renewable natural gas is much lower than their European 
counterparts due to low yields leading to high emission credits (ibid)

4  Comparison of GHG databases 

4.1  Comparison with European databases 

In comparison to publicly available GHG databases such as JECv5, RED II, UK BEIS and CO2 
emissiefactoren; the GREET model has a more comprehensive database and fuel availability, as 
shown  in  Table  2.  The  GREET  model  has  been  expanded  and  regularly  updated  since  1995. 
There  are  other  European  LCA  databases  with  wide  coverage  such  as  ecoinvent,  however,  it 
requires a licensed fee to use. 
The  major  difference  between  the  sources  is  the  handling  of  multifunctional  processes,  for 
example  when  a  refinery  supplies  a  wide  range  of  products  or  when  certain  biofuel  pathways 
produce  energy  or  animal  feed  as  a  by-product.  Oil  refineries,  which  are  highly  complex  and 
integrated  systems  supplying  several  assorted  products  with  different  properties,  require  an 
approach to allocate emissions to multiple products arising from the refining processes (Smart 
Freight  Centre  and  ifeu,  2021).  In  JEC  v5,  which  utilizes  a  consequential  approach,  a  linear 
programming  model  of  an  oil  refinery  is  used  to  check  what  changes  result  from  a  marginal 
difference in certain refinery output. Using these results, a division of the refinery emissions  is 
applied between the products resulting in relatively high emissions for products that are in high 
demand such as diesel or gasoline and lower emissions (or negative emissions) for products like 
bitumen or heavy fuel oil (ibid). This differs from the approach taken by GREET which primarily 
uses  the  attributional  LCA  approach  to  assign  refinery  emissions,  where  the  energy  and 
emissions burdens of individual intermediates are estimated within the refinery by allocating the 
burdens at the process/unit level using energy allocation by default. These approaches lead to a 
different balance in emissions across the refinery outputs. In contrast to JEC v5, the RED II follows 
a mainly attributional approach by allocating the process emissions to products according to the 
share of the energy content.  
The  UK  BEIS  and  CO2emissiefactoren  website  data  have  a  similar  approach  as  their  primary 
function  is  to  provide  information  in  a  particular  format  that  is  more  directly  useable  by 
practitioners, whether companies with a need to report emissions or those that support them to 
do  so.  UK  BEIS  provides  much  greater  detail  in  the  background  and  breakdown  of  emission 
factors  with  a  more  comprehensive  self-contained  analysis,  whereas  the  CO2emissiefactoren 
website generally includes data from well-regarded external sources. Both data sources can be 
traced back to the JEC WTW v4 study published in 2014.  
The  attributional  approach  is  generally  preferred  for  GHG  accounting  since  it  is  based  on  the 
typical emissions from the fuels, whereas the consequential approach is more appropriate for use 
in  assessing  changes  away  from  the  current  situation  and  looking  at  the  effect  of  substituting 
current fuels or production processes with alternative technologies and feedstocks.

In GREET, emission factor values are subdivided into feedstock, fuel and vehicle operation.  In 
reporting  the  emission  factors  from  the  GREET  model,  the  TTW  value  consists  of  traditional 
greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and air pollutants such as CO (carbon monoxide) & VOC 
(volatile organic compound) which are oxidized into CO2.  
The  GHG  emission  factor  values  from  the  GREET  model,  which  are  subdivided  into  different 
emission categories apart from CO2, are clearly mentioned, whereas for RED II  this is not the 
case. For JECv5, the emissions are split into CO2, CH4 and N2O based on IPCC 2007, however, 
the exact characterization factors are not stated in the text or excel file. However, to be consistent 
with guidelines from GHG protocol, the GLEC Framework does not include CO & VOC values, 
only  CH4 and N2O values  are  included. However, CO & VOC values  are counted  in their fully 
oxidized form as CO2 in the GREET model. 
Furthermore, when calculating TTW values for biobased fuels, (biogenic) CO2 is considered zero 
due  to  the  assumption  that  CO2  that  is  released  was  previously  absorbed  by  plants  and 
animals[10], [30]. In the case of biomethane from all waste based feedstocks, there is credit for 
avoiding direct methane emissions given to the output.  
On a case-by-case basis, the GHG emissions from feedstock cultivation can be higher for certain 
biofuels  in  Europe  as  compared  to  North  America  due  to  the  contribution  of  land-use  change 
emissions and the productivity and yield capacity of the feedstock. In Europe, a high proportion 
of  the  feedstocks  is  imported  whereas  the  balance  appears  to  favor  domestically  grown  or 
produced feedstocks in the US.

4.2  Coverage of fuels 

In a comparison of all the approaches of the sources for road fuel pathways, Table 3 sets out a 
summary of the coverage. The coverage of CO2emissiefactoren and UK BEIS reflects fuels that 
currently exist in the market, whereas RED II focuses on biofuels and the JEC WTW v5 presents 
a broad set  of current  and potential future road transport fuels as  possible for  the  EU market, 
while  GREET  presents  an  extensive  set  of  fuel  production  pathways  for  the  North  American 
market. 
Currently, GREET consists of more than 100 production pathways (for fuels and products) from 
various  energy  feedstock  sources  including  conventional  fossil  resources  such  as  petroleum, 
natural  gas,  and  coal  along  with  renewable  fuel  pathways  from  corn,  sugarcane,  soybeans, 
cellulosic biomass, waste feedstocks, etc. The JECv5 study also contains many fuel categories 
such as fossil-derived fuels, biofuels from vegetable oil, ethers, hydrogen, etc. in contrast RED II 
only  contains  biofuels.  Compared  to  sources  in  Europe,  GREET  is  not  limited  to  the  HVO 
(Hydrotreated  vegetable  oil)  process  to  produce  renewable  diesel,  it  also  includes  other 
processes  such  as  gasification,  pyrolysis  and  other  biochemical  and 
thermochemical 
technologies.  
The only similarity between all these sources is coverage of the conventional biofuels such as 
HVO, bioethanol and biodiesel that are well enough established in the market.

4.3  Compatibility with the GLEC approach 

Although the GREET and the GLEC Framework have many similarities in accounting principles, 
which  are  highly  compatible,  there  are  slight  methodological  differences.  There  are  some 
inconsistencies in the GHG accounting rules among the emission factor developers, regulatory 
operators such as Low Carbon Fuel  Standard used by GREET model and Renewable Energy

Directive  used  in  Europe,  and  standard  developers  (e.g.  GHG  protocol  used  by  the  GLEC 
Framework). This creates uncertainty in the market for fuel suppliers and end-users intending to 
use  low-emission  fuels  e.g.,  biofuels.  This  leads  to  an  aggravated  issue  when  a  certain 
corporation’s transport operation spans different regulatory boundaries such as Europe and the 
US.  
An example could be the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, intending to incentivize the fuel market in 
California, which includes avoided emissions to the carbon intensity for biofuels reported in the 
GREET  model,  whereas  the  GHG  Protocol  does  not,  as  reported  in  the  GLEC  Framework. 
Instead,  the  GHG  Protocol,  which  sets  the  standard  for  corporate  emission  accounting, 
recommends that avoided emissions are not to be added into the Scope 3 when calculating the 
final  WTT  values.  End-users  accounting  GHG  emissions  are  confused  by  these  different 
approaches and how to account for these principles in their reporting structure.  
Therefore, it is required to modify the GREET emission values for example for renewable natural 
gas due to credits for avoided emissions as it leads to negative value which is not in line with the 
attributional  approach  followed  by  the  GLEC  Framework  and  ISO  14083.  Thus,  the  report 
currently shows the emission factors of fuels as represented in the GREET model for the time 
being,  however,  to  be  included  in  and  aligned  better  with  the  GLEC  Framework,  these  values 
need to be modified. Thus a common consensus is required for the freight sector with a special 
focus  on  harmonizing  emission  factors  across  Europe  and  the  US,  and  expanding  further  to 
accommodate a global emission database in the near future. 
Other challenges faced by fuel suppliers  in the GLEC  Framework revolve around dealing with 
biogenic  and  industrial  removals,  credit  schemes,  and  the  inclusion  of  iLUC.  iLUC  values  are 
provided separately if necessary and are not included in well-to-wheel values as the methodology 
to  estimate  iLUC  is  still  relatively  new  and  more  uncertain  than  other  aspects  of  the  emission 
factors.  Due  to  the  uncertainty,  none  of  the  sources  directly  include  the  impacts  of  land-use 
change; however, GREET, RED II and JECv5 do include a possible range of iLUC impacts from 
certain crop-based biofuels (e.g., corn, palm oil, sugarcane, rapeseed, soybean).

5  Results 

The objective of this report to publish well-founded information about the life cycle GHG emissions 
of potential  low  emission transition fuels for road freight  in the US has been achieved through 
outlining  an  overview  of  the  GHG  emission  factors  from  the  GREET  model.  The  report  has 
identified similarities and differences between GREET and European databases such as JECv5 
and RED II, based on their calculation approach and accounting rules. Emission factors for the 
same fuel can vary a lot depending on the database. This will form a base for the upcoming GLEC 
update  and  already  helped  in  the  development  of  the  US  emission  factors  in  ISO  14083 
(forthcoming). 
Fuel  emission  factors  depend  on  the  region  of  operation  due  to  different  feedstock  mixes  and 
region-specific processes or energy provision emissions (e.g., electricity used). iLUC is relevant 
and in some cases, a significant contributor to the overall greenhouse gas emissions of biofuel 
and is, therefore, important to consider. In GREET, CCLUB is used to identify iLUC values for 
different feedstocks, which are available on the Argonne National Laboratory website. In the EU, 
the RED II directive has provided iLUC values. As an end-user calculating the emission factors of 
fuels, iLUC values can be added using the respective databases. 
However,  due  to  high  uncertainties  in  the  exact  values  of  iLUC  emissions,  SFC  in  the  GLEC 
Framework  currently  do  not  include  iLUC  into  the  calculation  of  emission  factors.  In  the  near 
future, it is anticipated that iLUC values will be more widely available and reliant and therefore 
consolidated data on iLUC will be incorporated in the freight emission reporting.  
The results of this report can be further subdivided into two parts. One part identifies the structural 
differences between, and similarities among GREET, JECv5 and RED II,  the other part shows 
the outcome of the comparison of the emission factor values between the US and Europe. 

5.1  Comparison of the structure  

The report has identified various differences and similarities among the GREET model, JECv5 
and RED II models.  Table 4 provides the comparison of the emission factors of the fuel types for 
road freight in both Europe and North America:

▪  GREET has very extensive alternative fuel production pathways and covers more fuel types 
than RED II or JEC v5. However, the possibilities to include all fuel pathways in this report  
are limited due to availability of feedstock and products in each particular regional market for 
low emission fuels used in road freight. 

▪  Breakdown of tailpipe emissions in the GREET model are separately mentioned and divided 
into  the  three  traditional  greenhouse  gases  (CO2,  CH4,  and  N2O)  and  the  air  pollutant 
emissions from transportation fuels. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide 
(CO) are counted in their fully oxidized forms as CO2. Whereas, in the case of JECv5 and 
RED II, they are not separately reported.  

▪  Based  on a case by case  comparison, emission factor values for feedstock cultivation  are 
higher for Europe as most of the feedstock is imported, whereas in North America due to high 
productivity  and  yield  for  domestically  produced  feedstock,  the  contribution  of  feedstock 
cultivation to the emission factor is lower. 

▪  When considering renewable diesel, GREET is not limited to HVO (Hydrotreated vegetable 
oil) as it also considers other alternative processes based on gasification, pyrolysis and other 
biochemical and thermochemical technologies.  

▪  For the reporting and calculation of iLUC values, GREET includes more consistent and robust 
values than RED II and JECv5 based on the calculation approach described in the CCLUB 
and GTAP-Bio model. However, since there is no consistent way of calculating iLUC across 
different geographies and associated with different crop-based feedstocks, iLUC is therefore 
presently not included in the calculation of emission factors in the GLEC Framework. 

▪  The  corn  stover  industry  which  collects,  processes  and  transfers  corn  stover  to  biofuel 
industries do not need additional land to provide feedstocks but pays higher fertilizer costs to 
maintain productivity of land. Corn stover has little impact on LUC, however, biofuel produced 
from corn stover does not need land, it affects the land prices and marginally causes some 
reforestation  based  on  general  equilibrium  model.  In  the  real  world,  corn  stover  biofuel 
production may produce some changes in corn-soy rotation in the short run (F. Taheripour 
and W. E. Tyner, 2013). 

▪  Ethanol  produced  from  miscanthus  and  switchgrass  has  negative  LUC  due  to  net  carbon 
sequestration, as both crops are dedicated energy crops with high biomass carbon and soil 
organic carbon (SOC) sequestration (roots) (ibid), (X. Zhao et al., 2021). 

▪  Biofuels produced from waste streams such as used cooking oil, do not carry iLUC emissions 
since their use does not impact land use. It is therefore important to consider what the indirect 
emissions  associated  with  a  feedstock  are  when  assessing  the  emissions  performance  of 
various sources of biofuel. Currently, only values of iLUC for soybean and rapeseed-based 
biodiesel for the North American region can be found in the CCLUB model. 

From the initial comparison, it can be concluded that GREET values have some minor differences 
from  their  counterparts  in  Europe.  These  minor  differences  need  to  be  acknowledged  and 
adjusted to be incorporated in the GLEC Framework and ISO 14083. For example, the biogas 
values  are  not  included  in  the  ISO  14083,  due  to  the  credits  for  avoided  emissions  leading  to 
negative values as it is not in line with the attributional approach followed by ISO 14083 and the 
GLEC Framework. 

5.2  Comparison of emission factors 

The following figures show results for comparison of emission factors (composed of WTT, TTW 
and WTW)  for GREET, JECv5 and RED II typical values.

In  Figure  8,  in  comparison  to  fossil  gasoline,  the  WTW  GHG  reduction  of  bioethanol  from 
sugarcane is   65%. However, there is a small fraction of methane and N2O is present in the TTW 
values of ethanol produced from sugarcane and corn in the GREET model. Comparing different 
GHG databases, ethanol produced from sugarcane has almost similar emission values. However, 
for ethanol produced from corn, the emission values differ due to  differences in procurement of 
feedstocks as corn is domestically produced in the USA, while it is mainly imported into Europe.

 Figure 8 Overview of emission factors for ethanol and substitutes  

In Figure 9, comparing the WTW value of biodiesel from soybean, the value from GREET is at 
least 50% lower than the value from JECv5. The most likely reason for this is the production of 
soybean  domestically  in  the  US,  whereas  in  Europe  it  is  mainly  imported.  For  100%  biodiesel 
blends in the GREET, the emission values include fossil methanol which acts as a denaturant 
has an emission value of 4.02g CO2e/MJ. 
Biodiesel values have lower WTW emissions than renewable diesel due to the energy required 
for producing renewable diesel being much higher. The renewable diesel values  in the GREET 
model are taken from the ASPEN+ model which is a leading chemical process simulator in the 
market. Only first and second-generation feedstocks for biodiesel and renewable diesel can be 
seen (for 3rd generation feedstock values refer to the GREET1 model).

Figure 9 Overview of emission factor for diesel and substitutes 

Emission factors are generally shown on the basis of each fuel (energy carrier).  In Figure 10, 
however, methane-based fuels present a difficulty in that  as the overall emissions depends on 
the extent of methane slip, which itself depends on the effectiveness of the engine in preventing 
this  leakage  of  methane,  a  powerful  greenhouse  gas  in  its  own  right,  to  the  atmosphere.  .  In 
GREET, the carbon intensities of waste derived renewable natural gas is much lower than their 
European  counterparts  leading  to  high  emission  credits  and  negative  emission  factors.  In 
comparison, the Bio-LNG value from waste stream for GREET is at least 78% lower than the JEC 
v5 value mainly due to carbon credits.  
Bio-LNG values vary significantly due to the difference in emissions linked to each feedstock and 
process combination.  Credits for the avoided emission of CH4 make a significant contribution for 
some options.

Figure 10 Overview of emission factors for LNG and substitutes 

It can be concluded that there are many similarities in RED II, JECv5 and GREET model, with 
three  differences  in  accounting:  (i)  accounting  of  methane  slip,  (ii)accounting  of  iLUC,  and  (iii) 
accounting of avoided emissions. The JECv5 follows consequetional approach as compared to 
RED  II  attributional  approach,  GREET  follows  a  hybrid  approach  where  both  attribuitional  and 
consequetional are used. There is a further variation in completeness of different feedstocks/fuel 
pathways  which  can  be  explained  from  different  availability  and  pathways.  Thus,  there  is  a 
particular need for harmonization of approaches for emission factors between the US and Europe 
with development of principles when developing emission factors for GHG emission reporting, in 
particular for emission factors that are evolving over time.  

It  is  recommended  that  the  methane  slip  should  be  included  in  the  emission  factors  moving 
forward (as it is currently included in the GLEC Framework). iLUC should be reported seperately 
considering the current Land Sector Removals Guidance, until there is a reliable and consistent 
way to estimate iLUC values.

6  Future work 

This  report  has  highlighted  the  major  differences  between  and  similarities  among  the  fuel 
emission factors commonly used in Europe and the US. However, it is recommended to consider 
the following at later stages to provide a better understanding of the calculation of emission factors 
for low emission fuels. 
▪  Address  the  (i)  inclusion  of  methane  slip,  and  (ii)  avoided  emissions  in  GHG  accounting 

principles for the end-users to have a universal accounting and reporting structure. 

▪  Develop principles to take into account when developing emission factors for GHG emission 
reporting, in particular as emission factors are evolving over time due to the introduction of 
new energy carriers, the available technology for the production of fuels improves, and lower 
emission energy sources are deployed to power production processes.  

▪  Review  how  iLUC  emissions  can  be  estimated  with  greater  reliability,  such  that  it  can  be 

included in freight emissions reporting and the GLEC Framework emission factors. 

Future  work  will  include  reviewing  the  availability  of  synthetic  and  e-fuels  in  the  market,  their 
respective emission factors and their importance to be included in the GLEC Framework.
