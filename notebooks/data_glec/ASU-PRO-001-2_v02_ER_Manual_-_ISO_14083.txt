Emissions Reporter Manual – ISO 14083 
Edition: 02  I  Date: 30-09-24  I  A Smart Freight Centre initiative 

1.  Introduction 

1.1.  The  Smart  Freight  Centre  Conformity  Assurance  Scheme  (SFC  CAS)  for  'Validation  and 
Verification  of  GHG  emissions  statements  for  transport  chains'  provides  a  global  scheme  for 
independent  verification  of  GHG  emissions.  It  is  based  on  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  ISO 
standards as well as others that are specific to the SFC scheme as outlined in Section 4. It also 
provides optional performance levels for reporters to apply for, as they move forward along their 
decarbonization  journey  –  these  criteria  for  these  performance  levels  are  also  subject  to 
verification, if the reporter wants to apply them.   

1.2. The SFC CAS defines two technical scopes:  

1.2.1. ISO 14083 Scope: covered in this document. 

1.2.2.  MBM  Specification  Scope:  covered  in  the  Emissions  Reporter  Manual  –  MBM 
Specification (SFC-PRO-007-2). 

1.3. The ISO 14083 Scope of the SFC CAS aims to:  

1.3.1.  Recognize  and  encourage  reporters’  efforts  to  determine,  disclose,  manage  and 
reduce their GHG emissions, 

1.3.2. Provide a database for reporters to demonstrate that they comply with key standards 
for calculating and reporting GHG emissions in the transport sector,  

1.3.3. Share tools with stakeholders, such as a template for Emissions Report and a list of 
tools and programs approved by SFC as being compliant with ISO 14083,  

1.3.4. Provide high-quality training for emissions reporters and verifiers on the ISO 14083 
standard, 

1.3.5. Create a database of VVBs that reporters can trust to carry out a competent, impartial 
verification service,  

1.3.6. Specify clear rules for verifying GHG emissions, appropriate for the transport sector, 
that ensure a consistent approach is applied to all reporters. 

1.4. The Emissions Reporter Manual - ISO 14083 (this document) provides the specific criteria 
and procedures under which an Emissions Reporter’s (ER) disclosures become accepted under 
the SFC CAS, and by which the SFC CAS Performance Levels will be conferred. It also covers 
procedures that must be followed by ERs when preparing their Monitoring Plans and Emissions 
Reports, ahead of them being independently verified. 

1.5. This procedure becomes effective on the date of issue indicated above.

2.  Scope and applicability 

Edition 02 

30.09.24  

2.1. This document is applicable to all ERs seeking to be accepted under the ISO 14083 Scope of 
the SFC CAS following verification in accordance with the SFC CAS rules.  

2.2. Participation in the SFC CAS is voluntary and based on objective criteria. The scheme is not 
discriminatory to ERs or VVBs. 

3.  Overview of the SFC CAS 

3.1. Roles and Responsibilities 

3.1.1. Emissions Reporters 

3.1.1.1. ERs calculate and report their GHG emissions in conformance with the reporting standards 
set  out  in  Section  4.  They  are  responsible  for  their  Monitoring  Plan,  assumptions,  relevant 
calculations  and  claims,  and  for  selecting  and  interacting  with  their  VVB.  After  undergoing 
verification by their selected VVB, the VVB submits the Verification Opinion - which is the output 
of the verification process - to the ER along with a PDF of their final verified Emissions Report. The 
reporter, in turn, submits these to SFC. SFC then makes the opinion publicly available on the SFC 
Emissions Reporter database (known as Listing). 

3.1.2.  Validation and Verification Bodies 

3.1.2.1.  VVBs  verify  that  the  ER´s  Monitoring  Plan,  assumptions,  calculations,  and  claims  are 
transparent and conform to ISO 140831 and any other standard specified in their Monitoring Plan, 
and that declared emissions are accurate and in accordance with the standards and monitoring 
methodology defined in the Monitoring Plan. 

3.1.2.2. VVBs must be able to demonstrate and maintain impartiality while conducting verification 
activities.  VVBs  are  only  eligible  for  SFC  Approval  if  they  are  accredited  to  the  verification 
standards outlined in Section 4, including approval for the transport scope for verification. VVBs 
must sign the required Agreement with SFC before they can perform verification in connection with 
the SFC CAS. The list of SFC approved VVBs is available on the SFC CAS website.  

3.1.2.3. There are four stages of the verification process under the SFC CAS: 

3.1.2.3.1. The ER appoints an SFC Approved VVB. The appointment and contracting shall 
include the scope of work that is comprehensive and suitable for the claims being made and 
the verification service sought.  

1 The applicable version of ISO14083 is the one in force at the time of monitoring and reporting.  If an updated 
version is issued part way through the reporting period, the Emissions Reporter may continue to monitor and report 
in line with the old version for the object of that specific report; thereafter moving to the latest version for future 
reporting.

[Title] 

3.1.2.3.2.  The  VVB  conducts  verification  of  the  declared  emissions;  the  ER  provides  full 
access to the information needed by the VVB to complete its work.  

3.1.2.3.3.  The VVB provides a Verification  Report containing its opinion;  if  the result is a 
verified2 opinion, then the ER sends the PDF copies of the Verification Opinion and the final 
verified Emissions Report to SFC.   

3.1.2.3.4.  The  relevant  verification  documents  are  published  on  the  SFC  website.  See 
section 5. 

3.1.3.  Smart Freight Centre 

3.1.3.1. The SFC CAS is managed by SFC. SFC is responsible for developing and managing the 
scheme. It maintains an impartial position in the freight/transportation market and does not develop 
emission calculation tools, nor does it provide consultancy or verification services.  

3.1.3.2. SFC runs an Approval process for accredited VVBs to provide verification services under 
the SFC CAS. SFC also operates a database of ER´s verified disclosures and performance levels.  

3.1.3.3. SFC reserves the right not to list VVBs or ERs where it deems that they do not conform 
with the scheme rules. SFC reserves the right to delist VVBs or ERs where it deems that they have 
not been verified in accordance with the scheme rules  or are in breach of their Agreement with 
SFC. 

4.  Documents 

4.1.  The  rules  and  requirements  for  the  SFC  CAS  are  set  out  in  the  scheme  documents. 
Complementing  this document  are  other SFC  procedures,  templates  and  forms,  and  standards 
issued by external entities or SFC. SFC may issue new documents. The complete and current list 
of the scheme documents is available on the SFC CAS website.  

4.2.  SFC  CAS  documents  are  given  a  version  number  and  specify  their  effective  date.  Where 
documents that are relevant for the SFC CAS are updated, the updates made will be summarized 
in an appendix table. If applicable, a transition period will be specified. VVBs approved by SFC 
and ERs listed by SFC will be informed of the updates. 

4.3. Where documents are referenced - and such documents are updated - the most recent version 
of the document should be used, and their transition period considered. 

4.4. The following are normative documents (i.e., standards) for the ISO 14083 Scope:  

A. 

Reporting standards: 

4.4.1.  ISO  14064-1,  Greenhouse  gases  –  Part  1:  Specification  with  guidance  at  the 
organization  level  for  quantification  and  reporting  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and 
removals

4.5.  The  standards  listed  above  are  part  of  the  requirements  of  the  SFC  CAS,  and  their 
requirements shall be met either by the ER (set A above) or the VVB (set B above). 

C. 

Guidance: 

4.6. The required scheme documents are complemented by guidance documents, which provide 
additional information to assist with the interpretation of standards - these are mentioned explicitly 
in ISO 14083 and/or published on the SFC website. An example of a guidance document is the 
GLEC Framework (SFC-GUID-001). Reporters are expected to follow the recognized guidance 
or explain  to their VVB why they have not and/or that the guidance they have followed is more 
robust. 

D. 

Definitions: 

4.7. Definitions as set out in ISO 17000 and the ISO standards referenced above apply to the SFC 
CAS.  

5.  Applications, Fees and Listing 

5.1.  SFC  charges  fees  to  cover  administration  costs,  at  the  rates  set  out  in  the  document 
Assurance fees for Emissions Reporters (ASU-FEE-001-2).   

5.2. To apply to the SFC CAS, ERs must complete an Application Form (ASU-TPL-010-2) and 
submit the signed application, along with all supporting evidence mentioned in the application form, 
to assurance@smartfreightcentre.org.  

5.3. Applicants must also sign the License Agreement SFC-ER (ASU-TPL-009-2), and pay the 
Listing Fee defined in the fee schedule. This fee covers the review of (only) one GHG Emissions 
Report per year, but more than one report can be submitted for listing. 

5.4. The application shall only be considered when SFC has received all the documentation and 
the Listing Fee. Applicants should only apply when they are ready to submit their verified Emissions

[Title] 

Report and Verification Opinion. If these documents are complete and correct, SFC will process 
applications from ERs and list them on the SFC website within 30 calendar days of application. 

5.5. Once the application is processed, SFC will add the ER to the list of verified disclosures on 
the SFC website, under the calendar year of the date of the verified report (the Listing Period). 
ERs can have multiple reports listed for each calendar year, providing they have paid that year´s 
fee. Listing of one or more reports that have been verified in a new calendar year requires payment 
of a new Listing Fee. 

5.6. Once Listed, SFC will keep that report on its database for 10 years, and a new year´s fee will 
cover reports being added in new calendar years. In this way, in case an ER decides not to pay a 
certain annual fee, past reports will not be removed from the database until the 10-year period is 
over. 

5.7. SFC defines two options for Listing of Emissions Reports: 

5.7.1. Reports to wider stakeholders, where the Emissions Report is published alongside 
the Verification Opinion [or the Opinion is alongside a link to where the report is published 
by the ER and where the ER includes a link to the SFC listed opinion in their report (pdf or 
website)] 

5.7.2.  B2B  reports,  where  both  Verification  Opinion  and  Emissions  Report  can  remain 
private, and there is an access code that the ER can provide to its report user so they can 
access the opinion on the SFC website to obtain assurance. In this case, the SFC public 
website would just list the ER and the report number.  

As part of their application ERs shall select which Listing options they choose, with the proviso that 
all reports to wider stakeholders (such as annual inventories) are on option 1.  

6. 

Emissions Report 

6.1. ISO 14083 defines the minimum content for reporting GHG emissions. Although no template 
or format is mandatory, clause 13.4.2 of ISO 14083 suggests the use of tables 1 and 2. SFC has 
made  available  a  template  for  Emissions  Reports  (ASU-TPL-011-2)  which  is  consistent  with 
these tables and which can be used, and allows simplification where sections are not applicable. 
However,  reporting  can  be  achieved  in  various  ways  and  formats  provided  that  the  minimum 
required content specified for the SFC CAS is included – this is outlined in the template.  

6.2. Once the Emissions Report has been confirmed as ready for verification it can be shared with 
the VVB. But once the VVB has confirmed the Emissions Report is final and prepared their own 
Verification  Report  (VR),  the  Emissions  Report  must  be  printed  to  PDF  format  to  give  an 
unchangeable version. The VVB will provide the reporter with a PDF copy of their full VR. 

6.3. Regarding publication of the Emissions Report,  where the Emissions Report PDF is placed 
on a website or passed onto a supplier or customer, the VVB's VR shall be incorporated into the 
PDF file of the Emissions Report, at the end.

[Title] 

6.4.  Where  the  Emissions  Report  is  published  as  pages  on  a  website,  the  VVB's  VR  shall  be 
published alongside it - either directly or accessible via a web link.  

6.5. Where the Emissions Report is published as part of an annual financial report or sustainability 
report, for example, a summary of the VR must be published alongside the reported data with a 
web link to where the full VR can be accessed. The text of any summary published must be agreed 
with the VVB in advance of publication. 

7. 

Performance Levels 

7.1. SFC has defined three performance levels within which verified emissions reports may lie and 
for  which  ERs  may  apply.  If  the  ER  intends  to  apply  for  SFC  recognition  under  a  specific 
performance  level,  the  associated  criteria  specified  for  that  level  will  be  included  within  the 
verification criteria checked by the VVB, and a statement made in the VR. 

7.2. The levels intend to signal aspects which are considered important, such as completeness of 
the report, transparency and data quality. There is an extra level which results in a “+” on any level, 
as in level 1+, 2+, 3+, for reporters who choose to also include black carbon in the data reported.  

7.3. The levels are described in table 1 below. All conditions and thresholds must be satisfied to 
achieve the required level. For data quality, there are two separate calculations: one for own fleet 
and another for subcontracted fleets; both must be satisfied to achieve the required level.

1.  Emissions are to be calculated in metric tonnes.  
2.  All % values are determined on the basis of the freight operator’s reported verified emissions (ie this is the denominator in the calculation). 
3.  This is a criterion that is NOT covered by ISO 14083, but must be defined in any verification service. 
4.  This is a criterion that is NOT covered by ISO 14083, but must be defined in any verification service. For levels 1 and 2, SFC does not define any threshold 

for materiality for verification. For level 3, SFC defines a threshold of 5%. A materiality threshold of 5% means that the VVB will still issue an opinion even 
if an AGGREGATE ERROR is detected that leads to a deviation of ±5% of emissions. But if the AGGREGATE ERROR leads to a deviation of ±5.1% then 
an opinion would not be issued. 

5.  Cut offs are the proportion of the data that can be excluded from the ‘defined scope’ of the report (i.e. deminimis exclusion). Cut-offs can be agreed to 

cover small emissions sources that should be within the ‘defined scope’ but are deemed deminimis and so can be ignored. Cut-offs are allowed by ISO 
14083 clause 5.2.3 with no threshold specified, which corresponds to level 1. For level 2 and 3 alignment was sought with SBTi. 

6.  For level 1, it is not mandatory to publish emissions at all. For level 2 the overall carbon footprint must be made publicly available by the reporter. For level 
3, all APPLICABLE information covered in the SFC template must be publicly available. Reporters do not actually need to use the SFC template, nor issue 
one document only, as long as it is transparent where all the information is published.    

7.  This indicator consists in the proportion of emissions reported that are calculated using data from primary, modeled or default data – for the reporter’s own 

and/or subcontracted fleets, as applicable.

8.  Monitoring Plan 

8.1.  Content of the Monitoring Plan 

8.1.1. An ER must prepare a Monitoring Plan,3, which is a document describing their methodology 
and calculation approach. This document can be given another name (e.g. Standard Operating 
Procedure  [SOP],  Reporting  Approach,  Accounting  Policy),  provided  the  minimum  content 
described below is covered:  

8.1.1.1. Definitions. 

8.1.1.2. Documentation of roles and responsibilities including quality control procedures and 
interactions with subcontractors.  

8.1.1.3.  Detailed  documentation  of  data  flow  from  source  (e.g.  invoice/meter  reading  for 
scope  2 electricity  use)  to  report,  including  identification  of  where data  is  held  by  a  third 
party on the Reporter’s behalf,  

8.1.1.4. Estimation methods, 

8.1.1.5. Assumptions underlying the  gathering of data, calculation factors, estimates and 
other calculations, for example, 

8.1.1.6.  Justification  for  any  deviations  from  recommended  data  sources  and  calculation 
methods, 

8.1.1.7. Description of calculations (including final calculation tools and templates), 

8.1.1.8. The internal controls over data generation, acquisition, accounting and reporting, 
which might include: data generation and validation, calculations, reporting and decision-
making timetable; project tracker of progress against timetable, as well as controls over IT 
and  data  systems  used  for  storage,  processing  and  manipulation  of  relevant  data;  and 
control over third parties that supply services relevant to GHG reporting. 

8.1.1.9.  Description  of  the  process  for  retention,  and  the  retention period,  of  evidence  to 
support data and information underpinning the Emissions Report. 

8.2.  Uncertainty and materiality 

8.2.1. SFC recognises that there is uncertainty inherent in the use of calculation tools, estimates, 
models,  defaults  factors  etc.  The  Monitoring  Plan  must  include  a  clear  description  of  any  such 

3 Both ISO14064-1 and ISO14083 are context specific so not all elements will apply to an individual Emissions Reporter, 
therefore the Reporter is required to compile a Monitoring Plan that details the elements that are applied in their context.  
Verifiers will check both the content of the Monitoring Plan against the ISO requirements; AND the implementation of the 
Monitoring Plan to confirm that emissions calculations are conformant with all three documents.

Manual - ISO 14083 (ASU-PRO-002-2).  

8.3. 

Internal controls and data retention  

8.3.1. An ER shall have an internal control system that shall comply with clause 8 of ISO 14064-1 
on GHG inventory quality management. 

8.3.2.  Emissions  Reporters  shall  retain  supporting  evidence  of  the  emissions  calculations  for  a 
minimum period of five years. This is in case there is a dispute about declared emissions or the 
verification process. 

8.3.3. Standard passenger mass (see clause 12.1.2 of ISO 14084) is not defined in the body text 
of  the  ISO  14083,  although  there  is  a  reference  to  a  "standard  equivalence  of  100kg  for  a 
passenger  and  their  baggage"  in  Annex  A  (A.4.2)  for  the  Aviation  sector.  The  standard 
equivalence of 100kg for a passenger and their baggage shall be used unless there is an adequate 
justification. This justification shall be included in the Monitoring Plan.
