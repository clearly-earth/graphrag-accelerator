About this report

Road freight remains central in supporting economic activity around the world, but the trajectory of the sector’s carbon 
emissions currently does not align with net-zero targets set by governments globally. 

This report documents the state of the zero-emission commercial vehicle market to help decision-makers navigate the 
nascent sector. It shows that despite economic and infrastructure challenges, the transition to cleaner road freight has 
started and is gathering pace. While progress varies widely between countries and segments, opportunities are emerging for 
market participants in all parts of the value chain including fleet financing. 

The report was produced by BloombergNEF commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management 
and in partnership with Smart Freight Centre.

Introduction and key messages

Sales of medium and heavy trucks with zero tailpipe emissions are 
growing fast, but the market is still in the early stages. Adoption 
varies widely between countries and vehicle use cases, though 
economics are steadily improving as battery prices fall. There is a 
growing opportunity for creative financing and business models to 
help this market scale up. 

● Emissions from commercial vehicles are set to become the largest 
contributor to road transport’s CO2 footprint, surpassing passenger 
cars in the coming years. Without further action, the medium- and 
heavy-duty truck sector is far from a trajectory consistent with net-zero 
carbon emissions by 2050.

● Zero-emission truck sales were close to 38,000 units globally in the 
first half of 2024 and are set to be just over 1.5% of total sales in 
2024. Sales in China account for more than 80% of global volume, 
with adoption approaching 5.5% in the first half of 2024. In Europe, 
sales are concentrated in a handful of countries, while the US market 
shows only limited market growth. 

● Battery-electric trucks accounted for more than 90% of zero-emission 
medium and heavy truck sales in 1H 2024. Fuel-cell trucks have 
mostly been sold in China, where subsidies and availability of 
hydrogen fuel as a by-product from industrial operations have 
supported the market. Battery swapping is also playing a role. 

● Prices for commercial vehicle batteries in China are the lowest 

globally at $100 per kilowatt-hour, but prices elsewhere have been 
declining faster. BNEF expects battery packs for trucks to cost as 
little as $88/kWh by 2030.

● Electric trucks are quickly becoming economically competitive to 

equivalent diesel vehicles, starting with shorter routes. Even before 
2030, heavy-duty long-haul battery trucks can also reach total cost of 
ownership parity. Fuel-cell truck costs may also drop by that time, 
but the decline trajectory is far less certain.

● Manufacturers have set ambitious targets for zero-emission truck 

sales by 2030 and beyond. However, progress varies and remains 
limited for some large truckmakers. Strict emissions standards in 
Europe and the US should kickstart stronger growth.

● While zero-emission vehicle economics improve, capital cost and 

refueling challenges remain. But new business models and financing 
structures are emerging to tackle such hurdles. These include 
partnerships between fleet owners and operators to co-develop 
refueling stations, raising financing supported by fleet utilization 
agreements, and extending the revenue potential of vehicle batteries 
by reusing them in stationary energy storage applications. Fleet 
owners and investors that grab the early opportunities help create 
the necessary scale for themselves and the market to sustain further 
growth.

Global road transport emissions reached 6.3 gigatons of CO2 (GtCO2) 
in 2023, surpassing their previous high set in 2019.

The global fleet of 1.3 billion passenger cars emitted the bulk of that 
CO2 last year. Electric vehicles are starting to impact these emissions 
in the passenger car segment. EV sales this year will reach 16.6 million, 
accounting for just under 20% of new car sales and about 4% of the 
global car fleet according to recent BNEF analysis.  

Buses, 2-/3-wheelers

Commercial vehicles

Passenger vehicles

CO2 emissions from commercial vehicles are set to overtake passenger 
cars as the largest emitting sector in road transport by 2040, despite the 
fact that the commercial vehicle fleet remains just under a quarter the 
size of that of passenger cars.

More than 250 million vans and trucks were on the road at the end of 
2023, and accounted for just over 40% of CO2 emissions from road 
transport. Low- and zero-emission technologies are being adopted at a 
much slower rate than in cars, buses and other vehicles. 

By 2050, the commercial vehicle fleet will grow by more than a third. 
While efficiency improvements and electrification can offset some of 
that growth, without further progress such vehicles would emit almost 
2.2GtCO2, only slightly less than in 2023.

Global medium- and heavy-duty truck sales grew nearly 20% and 
exceeded 5 million vehicles in 2023, surpassing their previous highs in 
2021. Fleet replacements and solid levels of economic activity 
supported demand for goods transport and other activities in several 
countries. 

China and the US are by far the largest truck markets globally, 
accounting for 17-22% of total 2023 and 1H 2024 sales. India and the 
combined European market were at about 7-8% of global sales each.

Growth patterns differs markedly between countries. In more mature 
markets like some European countries, the US and even China, sales 
are driven by replacements and modest growth. In emerging and 
developing countries, truck sales follow overall economic growth. 

In this report, we account for medium- and heavy-duty commercial 
vehicles and exclude light-duty commercial vehicles, such as delivery 
vans, and buses. Sales and fleet in the latter segment are about twice 
as large as those of all kinds of trucks combined. While vans and trucks 
share some similar technology options to reduce emissions, they also 
differ markedly in engineering, manufacturing, energy requirements and 
customization.

The global truck fleet, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks and 
excluding delivery vans and buses, exceeded 83 million vehicles in 
2023, growing just under 3% from the previous year. The US is home to 
most medium- and heavy-duty trucks, at about 18% of the global fleet, 
followed by China, Europe and India. 

The global fleet size depends on the demand for goods movement, 
which increased 1.7% in 2023, with activity levels now back on their 
pre-2019 long-term trajectory. Growth centers are gradually shifting 
towards developing and emerging economies, where heavier trucks 
become more common as logistics infrastructure continues to improve.

Such growth patterns are affecting the adoption of cleaner propulsion 
technologies for commercial vehicles. In countries with more modest 
sales and fleet growth, such as the US and some European markets, 
new powertrains enter the mix by substituting existing vehicles. 

In contrast, in many countries that are set to experience the strongest 
demand, especially for heavier vehicles, new trucks are also used to 
satisfy additional demand for goods movement and services.

China is the largest market for battery and hydrogen truck, accounting 
for more than eight out of 10 such vehicles sold globally in 1H 2024. 
Sales of zero-emission trucks in the country have grown continuously 
year-on-year since 2021. Domestic manufacturers including SANY, 
XCMG and others dominate the market with advanced products 
benefiting from the country’s mature battery supply chain.

Sales in Europe picked up in 2022 and 2023 from a low base to about 
8,000 e-trucks. Incumbent truck manufacturers – particularly Volvo, but 
also Daimler and Ford – hold large market shares in the region. 

The US market for zero-emission trucks is small, with about 1,000 units 
sold in 1H 2024. The market lacks supply of suitable models, and a few 
startup manufacturers have failed yet to scale-up production.

In other countries, electric trucks remain a niche market, with just a few 
dozen units sold in Japan, India, Canada and Australia. Chinese e-truck 
makers are already looking to global markets in Southeast Asia and 
South America to export their battery trucks.

Fuel cell

Plug-in hybrid

Battery electric

Battery technology experience and maturity has led to performance 
capabilities that can satisfy an increasingly wide range of use cases. 
Short-haul and urban routes are most of the early applications. Vehicles 
with least 500 kilometers of driving range from one charge have been 
launched in Europe and the US, but their availability remains low. 

While such trucks haven’t been in operation for long, e-bus and e-truck 
fleet operators spoken to for this research indicated that battery 
performance is as good as, or better than, manufacturer specifications.

Fuel-cell trucks were about 5% of global low- and zero-emission truck 
sales in 1H 2024. Volumes outside of China are minimal, as 
manufacturers have yet to increase production, while hydrogen supply 
remains uncertain and expensive. 

Plug-in hybrid trucks were about 3% of global ZEV sales in 1H 2024. 
Sales took place almost exclusively in China, and these models were 
barely available in previous years.

Many global manufacturers have plans to offer fuel-cell trucks, but sales 
have been concentrated in China so far. High upfront vehicle costs and 
refueling costs have been the major barriers to wider adoption. China’s 
fuel-cell truck market is dominated by local players such as Yutong and 
FAW. Manufacturing subsidies offered by some provincial governments 
helped to scale production in the past two years, driving China’s total 
fuel-cell truck sales to over 3,000 vehicles in 2023.

Current use cases for hydrogen trucks are mostly confined to urban and 
closed loop settings due to lack of refueling infrastructure. In China, 
some companies use grey hydrogen, an industrial by-product, to 
operate their fuel-cell trucks, since green hydrogen is expensive and 
rarely available.

Some Chinese provinces started exempting H2 trucks from road tolls in 
2024 to encourage their use in regional and long-haul duty cycles. This 
could somewhat alleviate the high operating costs of these vehicles.

In the US, Nikola has delivered over a hundred hydrogen trucks so far 
in 2024, while providing customers with mobile refuelers as a temporary 
solution. The market in Europe was of similar size in 1H 2024, with a 
few dozen fuel-cell trucks registered.

Catalysts to early adoption in different countries include the presence of 
manufacturers, value chain maturity, availability of charging 
infrastructure and policy incentives. 

China leads e-truck sales globally in absolute volume. The country’s 
mature battery supply chain supports standardization of batteries and 
charging, which have enabled sales of trucks with swappable batteries. 

Norway boasts the highest adoption rate of e-trucks in 2024. The 
presence of Volvo and Scania in Nordic countries, has helped lift e-truck 
sales in the region. However, adoption in Europe is highly uneven 
between countries.

In the US, the zero-emission truck sales share is among the lowest 
among advanced trucking markets. Current policies, such as financial 
support for purchasing trucks in some states and California’s mandates, 
have yet to kickstart the market.

Elsewhere, electric and hydrogen truck sales are patchy and low. A few 
Chinese manufacturers expanding beyond their domestic market have 
delivered most e-trucks in other countries.

Battery swapping has been part of China’s electric truck growth story. In 
2023 around half of the more than 30,000 heavy-duty e-trucks sold in 
the country were battery swappable models.

Charging only

Battery
swapping

The technology offers short refueling time, lower upfront cost and the 
potential to optimize the timing and cost of charging. All these can 
improve an e-truck’s utilization and lower its total cost of ownership. 

Battery swapping can also help separate the cost of the truck from that 
of the battery, and lower the electrification requirements for smaller 
fleets by as much as two-thirds of the cost of an e-truck in China. 
Battery swapping banks can potentially help stabilise the grid. 

This requires standardized battery systems and recycling networks, 
where third-party operators – so-called battery banks – can provide 
rental services and take on battery residual value risk. While in China 
CATL batteries for trucks are generally accepted by battery banks, other 
customized designs in the country and abroad may not be as 
transferrable.

Government backing is important in deploying and scaling up the 
technology, due to the high initial capital costs for the swap stations, the 
need for standardization and the requirement for electric utility 
involvement.

The European zero-emission truck market grew 2.5 times from 2022 to 2023. Growth has since slowed to 30% in 1H 2024 and adoption has been 
around 2.1-2.3% of total sales for the last four quarters until 2Q 2024. Adoption and growth rates differ widely between countries. E-trucks exceeded 
4% of sales in several countries, with over 10% in Norway in 1H 2024, and they were comparatively high in the UK and Germany at around 2.5% and 
3.5% respectively. But for many countries sales remain very low. In Poland, which has the largest truck fleet in the Union, e-truck sales were just a 
few tens of units in 1H 2024.

Early adopters and companies with green obligations, such as decarbonization targets or zero-emission terms in contract bidding, mostly support the

The market for electric and hydrogen trucks in the US remains far 
smaller than in Europe and China, with fewer than 1,000 vehicles sold 
in 1H 2024 across the country. 

California’s sales mandates, which have been adopted by another 10 
states, are already in place and require between 5% and 9% of sales to 
be zero-emission already in 2024. Sales in California accounted for over 
6% of the trucks sold in the US in 2023.

Battery trucks are mostly used as drayage vehicles in and around ports, 
and for distribution of food, beverage and consumer products. In 
particular, ports have been an area of focus for fleets and 
manufacturers, following funding programs including those provisioned 
by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Fleet buyers are based in California, but also in various other states 
such as Texas, and along the East Coast, including in New York and 
New Jersey. 

Hydrogen trucks are deployed in the US in larger numbers than in 
Europe, thanks to sales from Nikola. Since hydrogen refueling
infrastructure is patchy, the company is providing products to store and 
dispense hydrogen as well.

Zero-emission trucks have also been sold in Japan, India, Australia and 
Brazil. The market for such vehicles remains small and patchy, as one-
off deliveries to larger fleets distort quarterly volumes.

In Japan, the recent introduction of Fuso’s updated eCanter contributed 
to a spike in sales in 2023. Beyond that vehicle, few suitable electric 
and hydrogen truck models are available and sales in 1H 2024 have 
been far fewer. 

In Brazil, a market for electric trucks has existed since at least 2021. 
The few hundred units sold annually come mostly from Chinese 
manufacturers. Companies such as JAC and Foton captured most of 
the electric truck market with models in the medium-duty segment. 

In India, cleaner commercial vehicles have started to get some attention 
as well. The electric van market has been growing on the back of a new 
model introduced by Tata, while a new heavier-vehicle manufacturer, 
Tresa Motors, recently received an order for 1,000 heavy-duty electric 
trucks from logistics company JFK Transporters. 

Such examples of early adoption demonstrate the importance of 
suitable model availability in the nascent zero-emission commercial 
vehicle market.

Manufacturing or purchase subsidies for electric trucks have been 
available in China, Europe, and the US, such as point-of-sales vouchers 
in California and New York. These can help small fleets cover the high 
upfront costs of e-trucks.

As subsidies become costly to sustain longer term, governments in 
China and Europe have transitioned to offer operational incentives. For 
example, the EU is rolling out emissions-based road tolls for trucks 
starting in 2024. 

Refueling infrastructure incentives are also being implemented that 
include standalone truck charging targets, such as the Alternative Fuels 
Infrastructure Regulation in the EU and the National Zero-Emission 
Freight Corridor Strategy in the US. However, subsidies in some 
countries bundle truck purchasing and charging installation. This can 
delay deployments due to the typically longer timelines for infrastructure 
setup.

Environmental regulations for trucks and buses were more recently 
implemented compared to equivalent CO2 or fuel economy rules for 
passenger vehicles. The scope and stringency of such rules vary widely 
between countries. In some large truck markets, targets require average 
improvements between 0.3% to over 6% annually, which may reach 
even 14% for some vehicle types.

Advancements in combustion engines, materials, aerodynamics and 
tires can help manufacturers cover some distance to the targets. Still, 
the increasing cost of applying such technologies implies that adoption 
of zero tailpipe emission trucks and buses will have to increase 
markedly to meet the rules, for example in the EU and the US. 

Most of the rules mentioned here regulate vehicle fuel consumption or 
tailpipe emissions. Some governments plan to assess the possibility to 
regulate lifecycle emissions, which will also imply the inclusion of net-
zero emission fuels, such as hydrogen or synthetic fuels, as part of such 
targets.

Most countries do not have sales and/or purchase mandates for ZEV 
trucks yet, though California does have a demanding quota system in 
place.

The regulation offers various compliance flexibilities that could be 
helpful in the short term. It also only gradually covers the whole truck 
market, as medium lorries, trailers and semi-trailers are excluded before 
2030, and most vocational vehicles will be excluded up to 2035.

Failing to meet the targets results in financial penalties. In 2025, these 
can be less than €5,000 ($5,540), but can grow to more than €100,000 
per vehicle by 2035, according to BNEF estimates. Such fines are 
applied to all of a manufacturer’s sales in a year.

The Commission will review the rules by 2027 and will explore the 
option of regulating the lifecycle, rather than tailpipe, emissions.

The market for zero-emission trucks is attracting new entrants. These 
are not necessarily startup manufacturers, which have largely struggled 
to establish a presence, but incumbent truckmakers. 

These manufacturers are finding opportunities to serve segments, such 
as heavy-duty trucks for urban distribution, in which they may have had 
low penetration. At the same time, newcomers from adjacent industries 
are entering the commercial vehicle market. 

In China, companies outside of traditional truckmaking command high 
shares of the e-truck market. Machinery manufacturers XCMG and 
Sany, as well as bus maker Yutong accounted for more than 40% of 
electric and fuel-cell truck sales in 1H 2024. 

Volvo has a much higher share of the European heavy-duty electric 
truck market than its overall market share, while it is less active at the 
lighter end of the market. Traton and Paccar’s DAF have yet to scale up 
e-truck production in Europe and are far behind their overall market 
share. 

Of the potential startup disrupters, Nikola and Tesla have introduced 
well-received products, while companies such as XoS, REE and others 
are also selling their vehicles in North America. Still, most have yet to 
materially increase production output.

Manufacturers

Manufacturers are building supply 
chains for electric and hydrogen trucks
Truckmaker supply chain relationships

Major manufacturers are establishing internal capabilities and external 
partnerships to develop and build zero-emission commercial vehicles 
for various use cases. Many truckmakers based in Europe and North 
America are developing a multitude of technologies in parallel, including 
electric powertrains and batteries, as well as hydrogen in fuel cells and 
combustion engines.

Most of these companies procure battery cells from outside suppliers, 
while they produce their own packs. Some, such as Volvo, Daimler and 
Paccar, plan to bring cell manufacturing in-house later in the 2020s, 
while Traton has invested in a supplier, cell maker Northvolt.

Chinese truckmakers have taken advantage of the advanced battery 
supply chain in the country to develop expertise and suitable products. 
From early on, they adopted lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) cells to 
produce affordable vehicles with long lifetimes.

Fuel-cell technology is at an earlier stage and, given cost and 
infrastructure uncertainties, is mostly developed through partnerships 
and joint ventures.

In the first half of 2024, Volvo sold over 2,100 all-electric vehicles, more 
than Daimler and Traton combined. E-trucks and e-buses also account 
for nearly 2% of Volvo’s truck and bus sales, while equivalent shares for 
Daimler and Traton are near 0.5%.

For Daimler, Volvo and Traton, Europe and the US together accounted 
for around 70% of their 2023 revenue; that share was about 85% for 
Paccar. The European Union’s efficiency targets could require zero-
emission trucks to be around 2-2.5% of Volvo’s sales by next year, 
while for Traton, Daimler and Paccar’s DAF that figure is 4-6%. 
California’s mandates - which another 10 states have also adopted -
require between 5% and 9% of medium- and heavy-duty truck sales to 
be electric or fuel-cell vehicles by the end of this year.

Scaling up manufacturing capacity, especially in batteries and electric 
drivetrains, is the vital next step as companies establish the supply 
chain necessary for higher sales in the years ahead. Such expansion of 
the technology portfolio requires high investment and can also be 
challenging. Traton’s Scania, for instance, has faced delays getting 
battery cells from its supplier Northvolt AB as of 1H 2024.

Light-duty commercial vehicles, such as battery electric delivery vans, 
dominate the global offering, with close to half of all models available. 
Just over a third of models are heavy-duty trucks, which for now mostly 
target urban and suburban operations.

Manufacturers have focused on battery trucks, as fuel cells have longer 
lead times and are available from a few truckmakers only.

Battery electric models outnumber those using hydrogen by about 22-
to-1, reflecting technology maturity of battery-based powertrains versus 
those using fuel cells, and also the concentration of H2 truck offerings in 
the heavy-duty class. 

Fuel-cell trucks drive farther with one refill, but long-distance battery 
heavy trucks also are also becoming available.

Average range across fuel-cell models is around 500km, which can 
extend to almost 1,500km for some models. For BEVs, the average 
range is around 250km. A handful of models with over 500km of range 
are available to order, and some have already been delivered, but their 
number remains small.

Truck charging is part of such investment activities. China’s Qiyuan
Green Power, a subsidiary of state-owned State Power Investment 
Corporation (SPIC), closed its 1.5-billion-yuan ($210 million) Series B to 
roll out truck battery swapping and charging stations. The company 
currently has 600 battery swapping and charging stations in the country.

In the US, Terawatt raised $1 billion in 2022 to build truck charging 
stations along freight corridors in the US. WattEV, also a California-
based station developer, raised both debt and equity from Apollo and 
Vitol in late 2023. Beyond building charging stations, WattEV also offers 
electric trucks through leasing to fleets.

Electric truck capabilities are improving 
quickly 

eCanter 2017

eCanter 2024

Battery technology has been improving rapidly over the last 15 years 
due to improved engineering know-how and expansion of manufacturing 
scale. Energy density for batteries used in automotive applications has 
improved by just under 6% annually since 2010. 

Such strides in the technology are starting to have an impact in the 
nascent electric-truck market as well. Following limited production 
products in the late 2010s, which were mostly used in trials with 
relatively low genuine customer demand, recent vehicle launches are 
far better from a technical standpoint. 

Manufacturers and fleets also indicate good performance from newer 
electric truck models. For example, Daimler stated that its first long-haul 
electric truck, the eActros 600, “exceeds our expectations in terms of 
range and energy consumption”, while Tesla’s Semi seems to fare as 
well or better than its expected efficiency of 1.7-1.8 kilowatt-hours (kWh) 
per mile. 

The e-truck industry is still at an early stage. Several projects in the US, 
Europe and China are gathering real-world data on e-truck 
performance.  As the industry scales, such statistics will provide a 
clearer picture of ongoing technology improvements in the sector.

The average battery pack energy density in battery-electric vehicles has 
more than doubled since 2010, to 194 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). 
Batteries with higher energy density have lower material and 
manufacturing costs, are lower weight, and result in higher vehicle 
efficiency.

NMC is a high-performing chemistry, with some packs achieving 
250Wh/kg in 2022, and CATL’s Qilin battery entering the market in 2023 
at 255Wh/kg.

LFP technology continues to improve rapidly. CATL launched the 
Shenxing Plus in April 2024, capable of superfast charging, while BYD’s 
next-gen Blade EV battery is set to have an energy density of 
190Wh/kg.

By 2025, large cell producers aim to introduce cells with energy 
densities of 350-500Wh/kg, such as CATL’s “condensed battery” *. That 
could correspond to pack-level energy density of 280-300Wh/kg. For 
these, manufacturers will need to use silicon or lithium metal anodes, 
solid electrolytes and high-voltage cathodes. 

*While this target is for aviation applications and details of any automotive version 
are unclear, it helps contextualize what is possible with new cell designs.

The lithium-ion batteries powering most commercial vehicles and buses 
use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes. Since 2022, LFP share has 
grown rapidly and now accounts for more than 80% of capacity 
deployed in the sector globally. 

In China, companies such as Beiqi Foton Motor, SAIC Motor and 
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group use LFP, while Geely also uses lithium-
ion batteries that use nickel-based cathodes (NMC and NCA) for some 
longer-range vehicles. 

Outside China, firms are working with a range of chemistries, although 
this is increasingly trending towards using LFP. Daimler uses LFP 
supplied by CATL, as well as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) from LG 
Chem and SK Group. Alongside Paccar and Cummins, Daimler plans to 
produce LFP cells in the US with the help of Chinese battery 
manufacturer EVE Energy. Volvo is using nickel cobalt aluminium oxide 
(NCA) cells supplied by Samsung SDI, and Traton’s Scania procures 
NMC cells from Northvolt. 

LFP is cheaper than nickel-based alternatives, as it uses less-expensive 
materials and has a higher cycle, meaning it can be charged and 
discharged more times. However, its energy density can be 30% lower 
than NMC.

The volume of batteries produced can differ from nameplate capacity 
and will depend on plant utilization rates. For example, while China had 
2.2TWh of commissioned cell manufacturing capacity in 2023, utilization 
rates only averaged around 43%. For newer battery manufacturing 
facilities in regions with less-mature battery supply chains, the utilization 
rates could be even lower. Higher production costs, competition with 
low Chinese battery prices, and less manufacturing expertise is 
challenging manufacturers in non-Chinese markets.

The upstream battery value chain, including cathodes, anodes, 
separators and electrolytes, is also highly concentrated in China. While 
more companies like BASF, Umicore, LG Chem, Panasonic and even 
Chinese firms like Gotion and Huayou Cobalt are making 
announcements for component plants in the US and Europe, China is 
poised to remain the leader in component production capacity. The 
country also accounts for a high share of battery-metal refining capacity.

Pack prices in China are the lowest globally. The supply and demand 
mismatch continues in the country so far in 2024, with capacity five 
times as large as demand and low utilization rates for many 
manufacturers. 

Lithium-ion phosphate packs and cells were the cheapest, at $130/kWh. 
In 2023, LFP average cell prices fell below $100/kWh for the first time. 
Prices have fallen further in 2024, with cells from some suppliers in 
China hitting $50/kWh. Average prices for nickel manganese cobalt 
oxide (NMC) batteries were $130/kWh globally in 2023. 

Prices have been converging across sectors as the industry grows. 
Differences depend on maturity of the technology and order volumes, 
but also varied cell and pack design and manufacturing requirements.

Falling prices for battery metals, the turn to cheaper LFP chemistries, 
and growing order volumes pushed truck battery prices steeply down in 
2023, even outside of China. Larger cells used in trucks and buses also 
help further spread the $/kWh costs.

Volume-weighted average electric truck and bus battery prices followed 
the industry trajectory of decline in 2023 as prices for battery metals 
dropped. 

Packs costs outside of China saw the steepest price drop in 2023, down 
39% to $186 per kilowatt-hour. Still, that is 86% higher than commercial 
vehicle battery prices within China, which were only $100/kWh, the 
lowest across all vehicle segments. 

China

ex-China

The price difference is primarily due to the prevalence of cheaper LFP 
batteries in China. Commercial vehicles also have the price advantage 
of using larger LFP cells, up to 280 ampere-hours (Ah), compared to the 
typical 60Ah cells used in passenger EVs. Large cells require fewer 
connections, reducing the time and costs of assembling packs.

While more-expensive high-nickel chemistries have had a higher share 
in markets outside China in past years, global vehicle and battery 
manufacturers are increasingly turning to LFP. That explains some of 
the price declines and the closing of the gap with battery costs in China. 

Still, smaller e-truck battery order volumes outside of China continued to 
constrain prices in 2023, as it is more costly to produce customized 
cells in small batches.

BNEF expects battery costs to decline further over the coming years 
due to technology and manufacturing advancements, movement to 
lower-cost chemistries and heavy competition. 

Historical battery prices have dropped at a learning rate of 17%. This 
quantifies the percentage price decline every time the cumulative 
volume of delivered batteries doubles. Assuming this continues to hold, 
industry-average battery pack prices would hit about $80/kWh by 2030. 

Commercial vehicle manufacturers are likely to continue paying more 
for batteries. The premium for truckmakers over industry-average costs 
should decline but will also depend on segment and duty cycle. 

For lighter vans and trucks, that gap should not persist for long, as 
volumes are already increasing, and operating characteristics do not 
pose undue strain on the batteries. 

In heavier segments, a cost difference could persist for longer due to 
the additional engineering effort required to adapt batteries for specific 
use cases. For heavy electric trucks, BNEF expects batteries to be 
about 10% more expensive than the industry average by 2030, with the 
gap closing further in the 2030s.

Medium-duty trucks in urban duty cycles are used in distribution, 
sanitation, municipal services, construction and other applications. 
Battery electric trucks in this segment can operationally substitute diesel 
vehicles and could be as cheap to own and operate in the next few 
years, without subsidies. 

The cost of the electric truck is currently higher than the equivalent 
combustion vehicle, and the relative costs of diesel fuel and electricity 
determine economic competitiveness. 

For high refueling costs with electricity, the battery truck remains more 
expensive. However, in the mid-range of fuel costs – $4.5/gallon for 
diesel and $0.5/kWh for electricity – the total cost of ownership can be 
similar between the two technologies within the next couple of years. In 
areas with very low electricity costs, they are already competitive. 

By 2030, even with the highest electricity costs, the battery truck TCO 
can be roughly the same as that with the lowest diesel fuel costs.

Such relative economics and the potential for battery trucks to soon 
displace diesel equivalents within cities also holds for China and 
countries in Europe, as well as for heavier trucks.

In the near term, battery trucks could approach the total costs of diesel 
when low electricity costs are combined with high diesel fuel prices. 
Economics for fuel-cell trucks are more challenging, given high capital 
costs. By 2030, zero-emission trucks in the segment start to become 
economically competitive: 

● Battery trucks can be as cheap as diesel within a wider range of 

electricity costs. However, at the higher end of diesel and electricity 
prices, battery trucks remain more expensive to own and operate.

● Fuel-cell trucks have a narrower window of competitiveness versus 
diesel and all-battery vehicles, requiring low hydrogen costs to 
coincide with high diesel and mid-range electricity prices.

A critical aspect of competitiveness for heavy-duty zero-emission trucks 
is the cost of fuel. By securing relatively low and stable electricity or 
hydrogen costs, fleets could operate such trucks at costs similar to 
equivalent diesel vehicles. Such economics are at play not only in the 
US but also in European countries.

The prices of zero-emission commercial vehicles are higher than 
comparable diesel trucks and could deter some fleet buyers. Still, as 
costs decline, battery and fuel-cell vehicles in different segments should 
gradually reach upfront price parity with equivalent diesels.

● Medium-duty battery trucks can be about a quarter more expensive 
than equivalent diesels. However, that gap rapidly closes and before 
2030 they could be as cheap or cheaper to produce due mainly to 
falling battery costs. 

● Heavy-duty battery trucks for long-haul operations are about 1.5-2 
times as expensive as equivalent diesels, but could approach their 
prices around 2030. While their total cost of ownership may become 
favorable earlier under some conditions, taking advantage of that 
depends on the ability of fleets to pay the higher upfront price and 
spread the cost over the usage period.

● Heavy-duty fuel-cell trucks for long-haul operations may cost 2.5-3 
times as much as diesel equivalents. These costs are also set to 
decline and could approach those of diesel around 2030. However, 
the cost trajectory of fuel-cell stacks is highly uncertain, as the 
industry is at a very early stage.

Technology and economics

How to interpret battery truck 
manufacturing cost estimates

● Current prices for heavy-duty battery electric trucks can be 2-3 times those of equivalent diesel vehicles, while our estimated near-term future price 

premium is 1.5-2 times. Our pricing methodology is a cost-based approach and shows the unsubsidized price at which a manufacturer could 
theoretically build and sell a battery electric truck. The pre-tax retail price is the sum of direct and indirect production costs, plus a profit margin. 
We do not account for subsidies or any other policy measures that could affect the final price of an electric vehicle.

● The actual selling prices of future electric trucks would be similar to our estimates under certain conditions, where the vehicle specifications as well 
as manufacturer costs, battery prices, production volume, and cost allocation are the same as in our assumptions. An additional assumption is that 
truckmakers choose to price vehicles based on cost. We acknowledge that these conditions will not always be true for all electric truck models or 
for individual manufacturers. However, we expect they will be sustained on average across the industry and even more so as the market grows.

● We use average production cost structures, and we expect electric truck manufacturing to converge to meet these as volumes increase; in our 

assumptions, economies of scale are reached with production volumes between 20,000 and 40,000 trucks annually. However, companies outside 
of China are at relatively earlier stages in developing their electric truck manufacturing processes and expertise, which also affects their battery 
costs. Manufacturers further ahead in production scale up may have a price advantage and be able to recoup high upfront investments faster than 
their competitors.

● The price estimates also rely on the technical characteristics of electric trucks, such as electric range and motor power. Some of our assumptions, 
such as driving range, reflect our expectations based on typical duty cycles, although this is challenging to predict. We have assumed that electric 
trucks have 150 miles of real-world driving range for urban duty cycles, 250 miles for regional duty cycles and 500 miles for long-haul duty cycles. 

● Truck batteries sizes for heavy trucks can range from about 300 kWh to over 900 kWh depending on duty cycle, but are dropping fast as battery 
energy density increases. In 2025, our battery price assumption for these vehicles is about $170 per kWh, which drops to about $90 per kWh by 
2030.

Zero-emission fleet deployment and 
financing strategies today

Fleets have been largely deploying electric or hydrogen trucks in known and repeatable routes, in areas with zero-emission vehicle mandates, or 
when they receive contractual payments for using such vehicles. Use cases include electric buses operated on behalf of a local authority, electric 
trucks in urban deliveries, and those going in and out of California’s ports and in the announced zero-emission zones in the Netherlands. In the past 
few years, two main deployment models for zero-emission commercial vehicle fleets have been used.

Fleets acquire electric trucks and set up refueling infrastructure in their depots.

These fleets can rely on traditional sources of funding to acquire the vehicles and install the infrastructure, such as their own equity, vehicle leasing or 
loans, as well as government grants and environmental credits. They use the services of charging providers, including local utilities, to setup refueling
equipment in locations they control. Typical use cases are electric trucks moving cargo on relatively short routes, aiming to charge every couple 
hundred miles of driving. China’s battery swapping stations and some fleet deployments in California’s ports and in the Netherlands’ announced zero-
emission zones fall under this model.

Fleets outsource parts of electric truck operations to service providers.

As above, fleets may own or lease the vehicles and install charging equipment in their depots. However, they contract with companies to not only 
build but also manage the refueling infrastructure and guarantee fuel costs. These are mostly newly established operators and can be funded by a 
combination of equity from investors such as infrastructure and real estate funds, and debt such as credit lines from traditional financial institutions. 
Grants and environmental credits are also used by both parties. This method has been one of the blueprints for deploying municipal electric buses, 
whose purchase may also be underwritten by contracts with transit authorities. Recently, the model is expanding to the deployment of heavy-duty 
electric trucks.

Zero-emission fleet deployment and 
financing strategies: The next stage (1/2)

Complexities in the zero-emission truck and bus market abound, and relate to costs, energy availability and technology maturity. However, rapid 
technology development and declining costs, as well as long experience with, primarily, the electricity markets create a dynamic environment in the 
trucking world. New business and financing models have already appeared, including fleet operators partnering with fuel providers more closely than 
is typical in the industry or refueling station developers raising financing secured on utilization agreements with fleets. Here, we present emerging 
models of addressing the real and perceived risks in mass deployment of zero-emission trucks and buses. 

Capital costs: Electric and hydrogen truck prices are high, but already follow declining cost trajectories, which also differ between segments. With 
high-volume manufacturing, some medium-duty electric trucks can reach upfront price parity with equivalent diesels within the next few years, putting 
them within reach of capital-constrained smaller fleets. Longer-range trucks could approach such points around 2030, even though their TCO could 
be favorable earlier. Larger fleets are more likely to benefit from the economics in the short term, but stacking up various subsidies and, potentially, 
environmental credits could also alleviate some of the cost pressure for smaller operators. For smaller fleets, financing concepts such as aggregating 
procurement and creating a leasing platform or a separate entity holding those vehicles, are being explored by the World Bank in Poland and Mexico. 

Fuel costs, grid connections and land availability: Deploying fleets of electric trucks in some applications could require high amounts of electricity, 
and station developers are adopting new approaches to secure energy availability and control fuel costs. Projects that include on-site microgrids, 
potentially coupled with stationary energy storage, are already being built to balance the cost and time delays of establishing high-power grid 
connections. Such endeavours have attracted funds from institutional asset managers, vehicle manufacturers and energy providers.

In many such cases, acquiring the right land is also critical to ensure locations that combine proximity to freight routes with enough space and 
adequate local grid capacity. These requirements are already drawing real estate investors, who become partners in refueling station and fleet 
deployment projects in the US and Europe.

Existing practices in the electricity markets, such as power purchase agreements and price hedging, also become part of the toolbox for securing and 
supplying the required energy.

Zero-emission fleet deployment and 
financing strategies: The next stage (2/2)

Battery residual value: The technical challenges of repurposing and reusing batteries relate to low performance once they reach their end of life. 
The packs that become available now were produced and deployed a few years ago when battery development was focused more on optimizing 
vehicle efficiency, and reuse was not a central part of producers’ considerations. 

Manufacturers are now starting to design batteries and vehicles with a view to the whole lifetime, to both increase their second-life potential and to 
comply with environmental regulations. At the same time, more data on real-world battery utilization and performance become available as lithium iron 
phosphate (LFP), with its long cycle life, becomes a main chemistry choice. While early data come mostly from passenger battery vehicles, they tend 
to show lifetime performance as good as, or even better than, expected at the time of initial deployment. 

Operators already bank on such developments to repurpose batteries and use them in stationary energy storage applications. The extension of a 
battery’s useful life can create additional revenue streams to the degree that some developers extend those batteries’ warranties beyond the 
manufacturer’s original ones. These early developments may also imply that fleet and station operators and lenders are able to extract value along 
various stages of a battery’s useful life and gradually address the corresponding uncertainties and risks.

The value of offtake agreements: Several of the emerging business and financing models for zero-emission trucks and buses require enough 
volume of vehicles, batteries and energy to make their economics work. For truck manufacturers, high production volume is also paramount to reduce 
zero-emission trucks’ capital costs.

Fleet owners, refueling station developers and service operators are already partnering in an attempt to achieve economies of scale by, for example, 
ensuring charging station utilization. These ‘offtake’ agreements, albeit few for now, can provide some certainty on the costs and returns for fleets and 
refueling stations. Similarly, efforts to aggregate demand for zero-emission road freight for shippers and carriers are also taking shape; for example, 
as part the e-FAST initiative in India and Smart Freight Centre’s Sustainable Freight Buyers Alliance. In turn, such visibility on operational economics 
can underpin the financing of large and long-term capital projects, including electric truck procurement and station development costs.

The Zenobe EV Delivery Truck Charging Facility includes in a single 
investment project with everything needed to operate a fleet of medium-
duty battery-electric delivery trucks. Beyond building and operating the 
station, funding was used for a batch of 60 trucks, owned by Zenobe, 
that are leased to the supermarket chain Woolworths. 

The project required the support of a government grant for about a third 
of the cost, while it also raised debt based on more traditional tools, 
such as receivables financing. While Zenobe is currently exploring the 
possibility of raising concessional finance, it sees a pathway to 
deploying a future stack of funds supported solely by the economics of 
using and operating such vehicles.

Some forms of utilization agreements for the charging station are in 
place and being planned. Woolworths is set to only use around half of 
the site’s chargers, and Zenobe plans to attract additional fleets as 
clients. These may use the station within specific time slots throughout 
the day. 

As with other early deployments of electric trucks, the project’s primary 
risks centre on the residual value for both the truck and its battery. 
Zenobe has been using vehicle batteries in stationary energy storage 
projects and has indicated that it will do so in this one as well.

Forum Mobility’s FM Harbor project serves California’s target to replace 
trucks moving containers in and out of the state’s ports with zero-
emission vehicles. Forum developed the charging site as well as 
financed the purchase of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks. It charges 
fleets a combination of a fixed and a variable fee, with operators buying 
time slots throughout the day. 

Financing the construction of the charging station and truck purchases 
was based on equity without a debt component. Regulatory credits from 
one of California’s main environmental programs will also provide 
recurring revenue to the station. To invest in such projects, Forum 
Mobility has formed a $400 million joint venture, which includes 
infrastructure investors CBRE Investment Management and 
Homecoming Capital.

One of the project’s main risks is again the electric truck’s residual 
value, while increasing station utilization is also a concern. As with other 
electric fleet deployment projects, required rates of return can well 
exceed 10%. 

To address such concerns, offtake agreements – whereby a fleet 
commits to some specific use of the charging site – were part of the 
project development. These could provide some certainty on station 
usage, and also help raise traditional types of debt to replace part of the 
project’s equity.

Battery-electric passenger cars operated on a commercial basis are 
part of Zeti’s platform, while the pipeline of additional fleets includes 
those operating zero-emission buses and trucks. Financing differences 
emerge between vehicle types, as high-utilization cars may already 
have favorable economics, while those of commercial electric vehicles 
vary across applications. 

Lenders use common tools to fund purchases, while for passenger cars 
more-flexible lines of credit also start to be used. But uncertainties over 
residual value and higher purchase costs pose challenges, especially 
for trucks and buses. That may lead to investment horizons of 14-15 
years or more to cover the full useful life of the vehicle. Because of the 
higher costs and longer timeframe, the fleet operator’s cash flow 
visibility matters. For example, contracts between bus operators and 
local authorities or logistics providers and retailers, may result in lower 
financing costs for such fleets. 

Expected returns are typical for similar projects, but they may be 
somehow higher and within a wider range for commercial vehicles. 

Charging approaches, and hence funding needs, between vehicle 
segments. The refueling infrastructure is part of electric bus and truck 
projects. These may include stationary energy storage and, potentially, 
power purchase agreements for larger fleets.

Commercial vehicles come in many types and perform 
several functions. Their operations vary widely, even for 
similar vehicles in the same weight segment. 

Light-duty commercial vehicles are typically vans or small 
trucks that operate within and around cities. They are the 
largest segment in terms of fleet and sales within the sector. 
Zero-emission models mostly consist of battery-electric 
vehicles, and adoption has been growing globally, albeit at 
different speeds across countries.

Medium- and heavy-duty trucks are used in several, disparate 
duty cycles. These include infrastructure maintenance, 
municipal services, urban distribution, and short- and long-
haul goods movement, among others.

While these vehicles’ sales and fleet are considerably lower 
than for light-duty commercial vehicles, they consume 
relatively more energy.

For the purposes of this report, we define zero-emission 
vehicles (ZEVs) as those vehicles that never emit carbon 
dioxide from their tailpipes. 

This means that in our categorization, ZEVs only include pure 
battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), 
neither of which have internal combustion engines.

It is understood that these vehicles should be fueled from 
clean electricity or hydrogen if they are to be truly zero-
emission in operation.

Electric vehicles (EVs) as a category are commonly 
understood to include plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

In this report, as in all other BNEF publications, we include 
PHEVs in our definition of EVs, alongside pure BEVs. 

However, PHEVs are excluded in some portions of this report 
that focus on ZEVs, as defined above.

Pages that focus on the broader category ‘EVs and FCVs’ 
encompass all of the above.

Hybrid vehicles that cannot be charged from an external 
power source are not included in our definitions of ZEV or EV.
