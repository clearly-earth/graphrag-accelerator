Executive Summary

With 8-10% of global GHG emissions originating from 
logistics operations, it is vital to take decisive action  
to decarbonize logistics operations and to stay on 
course to meet the Paris agreement. Freight buyers in 
collaboration with their logistics service providers can 
take such decisive action by transforming their logistics 
operations and including sustainability across all 
aspects of their logistics procurement processes.

The Procurement Playbook toward Zero Emissions 
Logistics Services presents a practical guide for 
professionals aiming to transform their logistics 
procurement operations and include sustainability 
within their logistics procurement practices. It proposes 
revisions to existing logistics procurement processes  
by defining a systematic approach to sustainability and 
relying on established standards and methodologies.  
It is designed for outsourced logistics services between 
freight buyers and their logistics service providers and 
is mode-agnostic. 

Through a series of workshops and roundtable 
discussions with freight buyers and logistics service 
providers, insights from logistics procurement were 
gathered, culminating in these concrete guidelines 
grounded in practical reality. The Playbook is developed 
by Smart Freight Centre and Implement Consulting 
Group in collaboration with the members of the 
Sustainable Freight Buyers Alliance. The Playbook is 
supported by the Scope 3 Peer Group and the World 
Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition. 

Navigating the dilemmas a procurement professional 
faces, such as seeking to trade-off cost versus GHG 

emissions reductions, and choosing between rapidly 
evolving fuel technologies, whilst seeking to adapt  
to emerging and upcoming legislations in multiple 
jurisdictions, is a significant challenge. This playbook 
enables any organization to make a choice on  
how to navigate the various dilemmas through 
characterizing two procurement strategies: 
transactional and transformational. Each strategy  
is tailored for different scenarios. 

Transactional procurement can be adapted through six 
interventions to integrate standardized decarbonization 
solutions readily available within a supply chain. These 
interventions are - including adjustments to the sourcing 
strategy, the specification, RFI/RFP, tenders’ evaluation, 
contract and performance management. 

Transformational procurement processes can be used 
to transform the operations and implement innovative, 
zero emissions logistics, and are required for solutions 
which are not (yet) readily available. This playbook 
provides a strategic framework on how to consider taking 
a transformational approach. Choosing the right approach 
requires you to assess your willingness to accept risk and 
uncertainty, understanding the market opportunities and 
the potential impact that can be generated.

Finally, the playbook provides examples of a logistics 
maturity matrix, standardized RFI/RFP templates and 
standardized bidding template in the various appendix.

The next step is for you to choose your approach, taking 
inspiration and utilizing the provided guidance.

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose and ambition

1.2 Audience and scope

While the importance of sustainability and the urgent 
need for climate action continue to gain increasing 
support and momentum, achieving the ambitious 1.5°C 
target requires a rapid and substantial reduction in 
global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Unfortunately, 
most companies are yet to integrate sustainability in 
their procurement practices, whilst nearly all companies 
are using procurement to service their logistics needs. 
Therefore, changing and integrating sustainability 
within logistics procurement will play a pivotal role in 
driving the necessary actions to reduce GHG emissions 
by half before 2030 and ultimately achieve net-zero 
emissions by 2050 or earlier.

The aim of this Procurement Playbook Toward Zero 
Emissions Logistics Services is to streamline and 
standardize the procurement of sustainable logistics 
services. This playbook provides concrete guidelines 
and concepts that are readily accessible and applicable 
for procurement professionals looking to procure 
sustainable logistics services, and are adaptable to 
industry or geographic needs. The guidelines can be 
integrated within their strategies and procurement 
practices. 

The playbook is developed by Smart Freight Centre 
(SFC), in collaboration with Implement Consulting 
Group, supported by Scope 3 Peer Group and the First 
Movers Coalition, aimed at leveraging the experiences 
of our members and partners. We firmly believe that 
freight buyers are pivotal stakeholders in driving the 
transformation of current and future logistics services. 

It is our hope that this playbook will contribute to 
standardizing procurement processes and enhancing 
communication regarding sustainable logistics services. 
Consequently, it will aid in establishing a common 
language and a set of metrics that ensure greater 
visibility of demand for zero emissions logistics services.

The primary audience for the Procurement Playbook 
Toward Zero Emissions Logistics Services are procure-
ment professionals seeking to enhance the sourcing 
process for sustainable logistics services. Employees 
interested in gaining a deeper understanding of  
sustainable logistics procurement processes and 
concepts can benefit from relevant recommendations 
and best practices applicable to their organizations.

The playbook caters to cargo owners or shippers  
and logistics service providers, considering both the  
perspectives of freight buyers and sellers. This inclusivity 
aims to highlight potential synergies and provide 
deeper insights into our recommendations, making  
the playbook more relevant and user-friendly for both 
parties. This also enables the identification of common 
touchpoints across the procurement process.

The playbook focuses on processes and dynamics 
related to sourcing logistics services from one or more 
logistics service providers (LSPs) within a transactional 
relationship, as well as sourcing logistics services from 
one or more LSPs in a strategic cooperation for specific 
equipment. It is important to note that we will not 
address challenges encountered by cargo owners who 
possess a large in-house fleet of equipment or those 
arising from the management of a dedicated fleet 
resulting from joint investments between cargo  
owners and companies in their value chain.

Furthermore, this playbook’s scope is specifically 
focused on assessing and providing recommendations 
applicable during the procurement process. Consequently, 
we will not delve into spot shipments or ad hoc equipment 
sourcing, as these typically result from gaps in the 
procurement plan (forecasting) or operational exception 
management.

1. Introduction8

1.3 Development process 

The Procurement Playbook Toward Zero Emissions 
Logistics Services has been designed based on real-life 
procurement use cases spanning all modes of transport. 
We actively engaged with our participating members 
through numerous workshops, use case discussions, 
and roundtable sessions. This collaborative effort 
allowed us to gather contributions, valuable information, 
and insightful questions. The outcome is a set of guidelines 
and best practices firmly rooted in practical reality and 
applicable to a wide spectrum of logistics services.

We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all  
our members who played an instrumental role in the 
development of the Procurement Playbook Toward Zero 
Emissions Logistics Services. Their commitment to the 
procurement of sustainable logistics services has been 
pivotal in shaping this initiative. Furthermore, their 
valuable feedback, stemming from real-world challenges 
encountered in the field, has been invaluable in shaping 
and refining our recommendations for achieving zero 
emissions logistics services.

1.4 Playbook structure

This playbook outlines the challenges and impacts 
associated with sustainable logistics, along with the 
compelling reasons why sustainable logistics are 
crucial in achieving climate impact goals by 2050  
or earlier.

Subsequently, chapter 2 provides an in-depth assessment 
of the current state of the procurement process for 
logistics services. This analysis identifies existing 
challenges and pinpoints the necessary changes 
required to strengthen the procurement of zero-emission 
logistics services. 

Chapter 3 will introduce two distinct procurement 
strategies between shippers and logistics service 
providers (LSPs): transactional and transformational 
procurement. Transactional procurement outlines where 
solutions are readily available and procurement can be 

standardized, whilst transformational procurement 
requires long-term collaboration and is suited for non- 
standard, innovative solutions not yet readily available.

In chapter 4, the various stages of the transactional 
procurement process will be outlined along with the 
necessary changes. Additionally, concrete recommen-
dations based on best practices identified among our 
members will be presented, ensuring that our guidelines 
are rooted in practical experiences. The playbook structure 
facilitates easy identification of the guidelines relevant to a 
specific stage of the procurement process. Consequently, 
this playbook can be used to redesign the complete life 
cycle or a specific aspect of the procurement process to 
integrate sustainability within logistics.

Chapter 5 outlines how a transformational procurement 
process can be used.

2.1 Leveraging logistics for  
climate action

Rising temperatures and the presence of short-lived 
climate pollutants pose significant public health 
challenges, impacting diseases sensitive to warmer 
climates (such as vector-borne and heat-aggravated 
diseases) and directly affecting air quality, food, water, 
and economic security. Implementing effective sustainable 
actions to limit temperature rise can play a crucial role 
in preventing millions of premature deaths, ensuring 
access to food and water, and building economic 
resilience.

While freight transportation was initially excluded from 
broader sustainability discussions, possibly due to its 
essential role in economic development and globalization, 
the consequences of a warming climate necessitate 
urgent action by logistics service providers. They must 
embark on the journey toward zero emissions services, 
carefully weighing the economic impacts against 
sustainable development goals.

Currently, freight transportation and logistics account 
for 8-10% of the total worldwide CO2 emissions. How-
ever, the ongoing rapid growth in freight transportation, 
driven by economic expansion and the opening of  
new global markets, particularly in Africa, Asia,  
and Latin America, is poised to triple transport  
volumes by 2050.  

2.2 Drivers for companies to act

Figure 4: Primary drivers of logistics decarbonization

Alarmingly, based on current efforts, CO2 emissions 
related to freight transportation are projected to more 
than double during the same period, reaching an 
estimated 6.2 billion tonnes in 2050.

With heightened awareness and concern regarding 
climate change, corporations face growing risks related 
to their resilience and overall business operations. 
Governments and regulatory bodies are introducing 
more stringent sustainability regulations, directly 
influencing corporate practices. Therefore, proactive 
assessment and operational improvements are essential 
for organizations to align with forthcoming regulations, 
such as the EU-Fit for 55 initiative and Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive in Europe.

Furthermore, analyses indicate that capital investment 
trends now consider sustainability (ESG - Environmental, 
Social, and Governance) strategies, with sustainable 
investors increasing their investments in companies 
aligned with environmental expectations.

Similarly, customers are beginning to evaluate companies 
and products based on perceived sustainability to make 
choices aligned with their values. While sustainability 
may not be the sole determining factor, robust sustainable 
practices can significantly enhance future sales activities.

Climate change is 
happening at an 
unprecedented pace,  
and many companies 
have seen the  
impact on their  
own operations.

National and inter- 
national regulatory  
bodies are increasing 
requirements to  
accelerate the green 
transition, such as the 
EU’s Green Deal as well  
as other national 
regulations being 
introduced.

Companies are  
identifying  
inefficiencies in their 
current operations that 
can be removed while 
transitioning to  
low-GHG emissions 
operations.

Many industries are 
moving toward a green 
transition, creating 
further expectations  
from customers and  
investors for  
companies to engage  
in decarbonization across 
the value chain.

Public awareness  
- particularly driven  
by the climate crisis -  
is resulting in current  
as well as potential 
employees demanding 
their employers to act.

A green transition  
creates new  
opportunities at the 
product/service level  
but potentially even  
in entire business  
models.

12

To successfully meet our climate goals by 2050, or even 
sooner, it is abundantly clear that the entire transport 
and logistics industry must come together to drive the 
necessary changes. Climate initiatives are underway, 
but significant variations in the commitment and scope 
of these efforts are still existing. Nevertheless, it is 
evident that procurement professionals play a crucial 
role in bolstering their organizations’ sustainability 
endeavors. Procurement holds a strategic advantage  

Figure 5: Four steps to logistics decarbonization strategies 

in driving forward the company objectives by actively 
engaging with suppliers, across all four steps companies 
take to act: from understanding GHG emissions, to 
ensuring suppliers have targets in place and pull the 
correct reduction levers. Procurement professionals 
translate these into sourcing strategies, supplier 
selection, forming contracts, and establishing  
partnerships with suppliers.

2.3   Dilemmas faced when  
integrating sustainability within 
the procurement processes

Logistics Procurement professionals are required to 
consider a range of dilemmas when sourcing sustainable 
logistics. The choice made depends on the individual 
company strategy, the level of risk appetite and the 
capacity to change.

•   Cost vs GHG emissions: Balancing the financial 

investment required for decarbonization efforts with 
the long-term environmental benefits can be a 
significant dilemma. Implementing sustainable 
practices often involves higher upfront costs, which 
may conflict with budget constraints. Securing 
logistics suppliers with decarbonization solutions 
aligned with our goals may require a stronger value 
proposition. 

•   EVs vs. alternative fuels: Choosing the right tech-
nology to decarbonize logistics operations can be 
challenging. Evaluating different options such as 
electric vehicles, alternative fuels or renewable 
energy sources requires careful consideration of 
factors such as cost, infrastructure requirements  
and compatibility with existing systems. 

•   Dance alone or dance with partners: Logistics 

operations often involve complex supply chains with 
multiple partners and stakeholders. Decarbonizing 
these operations may require collaboration and 
alignment with suppliers, customers and other 
logistics providers, which can be challenging due  
to different interests and priorities. 

•   Fix a country or fix the world: Keeping up with 
evolving regulations and policies related to GHG 
emissions can be a dilemma. Logistics professionals 

2. Importance of sustainable logistics procurement 
13

  need to ensure local compliance with existing and 
upcoming regulations while navigating potential 
conflicts with operational efficiency and cost  
effectiveness, which may require scale. 

•   Solve now vs solve later: The transition from 

conventional logistics operations to decarbonized 
practices may involve a period of adjustment and 
uncertainty. Managing this transitional phase while 
maintaining service levels, minimizing disruptions 
and optimizing costs can be a dilemma. 

•   Strive for perfection vs live with uncertainty: 

Collecting accurate data on GHG emissions and 
energy consumption across logistics operations is 
crucial for effective decarbonization planning and 
monitoring. However, data availability, reliability  
and standardization can be a dilemma that logistics 
professionals need to address. 

•   Compete vs. collaborate: Decarbonization initiatives 
can provide a competitive advantage by enhancing 
brand reputation and attracting environmentally 
conscious customers. The question is whether we 
can decarbonize faster on our own and make it a 
competitive advantage — or whether we need to 
collaborate to create the necessary scale and 
business case. 

•   Operational efficiency vs GHG emissions efficiency: 

Decarbonization efforts may impact certain  
performance metrics such as delivery speed, 
payload capacity or range. Logistics professionals 
must carefully assess and balance these trade-offs 
to ensure that decarbonization initiatives do not 
compromise the overall efficiency and effectiveness 
of operations.

2.4   Challenges to logistics decarbonization from a freight buyer 
and seller perspective 
Building upon the overall dilemma of integrating sustainability within logistics, 12 common and recurring  
challenges encountered by procurement professionals were identified. These are impacting the speed and scope  
of their sustainability efforts:

Figure 7: Procurement challenges: an overview of the obstacles

F

Lack of logistics GHG emissions data
Poor logistics GHG emissions data for both buyers 
and sellers.

Limited influence on logistics emissions
Buyers find limited success in leveraging their 
influence to reduce supply chain emissions.

Differing decarbonization ambitions
Buyers’ and sellers’ ambitions often differ in terms 
of speed and scope.

Lack of recognized KPIs
There are no commonly agreed standards for measuring 
and monitoring GHG emissions performance between 
buyers and sellers.

Lack of resources for delivering on sustainable targets
The current budget and resources dedicated to 
delivering on logistics’ decarbonization targets are 
lacking in the face of the necessary ambition.

Fragmented logistics supplier base
Buyers face difficulties in scaling their decarbonization 
plans due to a large and fragmented logistics service 
provider base.

L

Different regulations and policies
Buyers face difficulties in staying informed of the 
differences in regulations and policies as they vary 
across modality and geography.

Investing without guaranteed demand
Sellers face difficulties in investing and planning for 
low-GHG operations due to fluctuating demand patterns.

Setting GHG emissions value
Buyers struggle to define the internal value of 
emission: How much is GHG emissions valued 
compared to cost, reliability, availability etc.?

Sellers’ maturity and decarbonization solution vary
Sustainability maturity varies significantly, and the 
availability of low-GHG emissions solutions varies 
accordingly.

Difficult to communicate decarbonization requirements
Buyers experience difficulties in specifying and 
contracting low-GHG emissions solutions due to lack 
of experience.

Allocating ownership of new risks
The lack of technological maturity makes it difficult for 
buyers and sellers to contractually allocate risks.

The issues identified are widespread and relevant 
across industries, modes of transportation, and geo-
graphical locations. Despite conducting interviews, no 
identifiable patterns emerged to effectively prioritize 
these issues. These issues predominantly arise in the 
early stages of the procurement process but persist  
and manifest themselves in the later phases as well. 
Addressing even a subset of these challenges demands 
substantial commitment in terms of time and financial 
resources from buyers. While many companies have 
initiated efforts to tackle these issues, none have fully 
resolved all of them.

These issues, stemming from either the buyer or seller 
perspective, manifest themselves at various interaction 
points between the procurement and sales processes. 
To identify common challenges and empower procure-

ment to incorporate sustainability aspects into the 
sourcing and procurement strategy, the procurement 
process is mapped. 

The structure of a transactional procurement process 
mirrors that of a sales process for logistics service 
providers. Therefore, achieving alignment between 
buyers and sellers in their respective processes is 
crucial, ensuring a shared understanding of buyer 
needs and available seller services.

The milestones in both processes demonstrate similar 
characteristics reflecting their interdependencies.  
Mapping this process against the challenges encountered 
by freight buyers and their service providers allows to 
see in which stage challenges emerge and where to 
address them:

2. Importance of sustainable logistics procurement16

2.5   The necessary changes 
to logistics procurement

As previously emphasized, procurement is ideally 
positioned to tackle the current challenges associated 
with decarbonizing logistics services. These challenges 
primarily stem from a lack of maturity and experience 
in the adoption of new, sustainable technologies, their 
applications, and related processes. Consequently, 

addressing these challenges, and as such integrating 
sustainability into the procurement lifecycle, requires 
overcoming various hurdles to successfully contract 
sustainable logistics services.

Based on above challenges and common touch points, 
six interventions are identified to the transactional 
procurement process to integrate sustainability within 
logistics procurement:

logistics information 
in the RFI and RFP 
process.

Introduction of new 
contract language 
about low-GHG 
requirements in the 
contract agreement.

1.   Sourcing Strategy: it was discovered that procurement 
teams that failed to maximize the impact of sustain-
able initiatives often operated in isolation, separating 
sustainable procurement efforts from their organi-
zation’s broader sustainability strategy. To ensure the 
full leverage of carbon reduction initiatives, it is 
imperative to facilitate a seamless alignment of 
corporate goals with the sourcing strategy. This  
topic will be addressed in section 4.1.

2.   Specification: At this stage, sustainable require-

ments are defined to meet or surpass the objectives 
outlined in the sourcing strategy. Therefore, to 
prevent potential confusion, Procurement should 
review the specification step to enhance the clarity and 
accuracy of the sustainable needs communicated, 

while ensuring standardization to align with RFI 
requirements. Additionally, an effective method will 
aid in managing maturity gaps in supplier capabilities 
and the adoption of new equipment. This topic will 
be addressed in chapter 4.2.

3.   RFI/RFP: During the RFI/RFP process, it is imperative 
to incorporate sustainability requirements. At this 
stage, procurement stands to gain from implementing 
a systematic approach to sustainability, which 
ensures alignment and helps prevent potential 
oversights. Efficiency in the process is crucial,  
and it’s important to link and frame insights into 
supplier carbon performance according to the 
specific sustainability requirements. This topic  
will be addressed in chapter 4.3.

2. Importance of sustainable logistics procurement17

Although the steps of the standardized process requiring 
intervention have been evaluated, this procedure does 
not encompass the entire spectrum of potential colla- 
boration between a shipper and its suppliers. 

However, it was also discovered that transactional 
procurement processes have limitations. The market 
for zero-emissions logistics remains immature in  
many geographic areas, and the availability and cost  
of “standard” low-emissions solutions vary widely.  
This requires a different transformational approach, 
which is addressed in chapter 5. 

4.   Evaluation: The challenge related to the evaluation 
involves including sustainability in the assessment 
of the supplier’s offer to generate maximum value 
for the organization. Recommendations will be 
reviewed and provided on how to incorporate new 
sustainability requirements into the assessment of 
the commercial offer in a simplified and efficient 
manner. This topic will be addressed in chapter 4.4.

5.   Contract: The inclusion of sustainability criteria within 
the selection process, in addition to the adoption of 
new technology and processes necessitates an update 
of the current legal scope. This update must address 
the upcoming legal challenges in terms of sustain-
able performance expectations, related commitment, 
and risk ownership. This topic will be addressed in 
chapter 4.5.

6.   Performance Management: Incorporating sustain-
ability criteria and new processes into contracted 
logistics services necessitate monitoring the delivery 
of committed services within the agreed time frame 
by the supplier. Addressing the need for visibility into 
supplier carbon performance and other sustainability 
requirements in logistics services needs to be 
emphasized. This topic will be addressed in  
chapter 4.6.

2. Importance of sustainable logistics procurement3. Types of  

collaboration 
between shippers 
and LSPs

19

3. Types of collaboration 

between shippers and LSPs

The relationship between a customer and its suppliers 
can vary significantly based on the level and nature of 
collaboration between both parties. Although each  
relationship embodies a unique mix of commitment 
toward shared objectives, two collaboration archetypes 
can be defined based on the type of shared goals and 
methods of achieving them. These archetypes, trans- 
actional and transformational, represent two distinct 
paradigms in business relationships, especially in the 
context of supply chain management and procurement. 
The transactional approach is suitable for situations 
where the goods or services being procured are stan-
dardized, readily available, and easily interchangeable 
between suppliers while the transformational approach 
is more appropriate for procuring complex, innovative, 
or critical goods or services, where long-term relation-
ships, collaboration, and value creation are paramount.

In the very first stage of the process, a procurement 
professional needs to determine whether the trans- 
actional procurement process can be used or whether  
a more transformative approach should be applied 
instead.

3.1 The Transactional approach

The transactional approach relies on the transactional 
and standardized procurement process and provides 
efficiency in managing information and the ability  
to assess numerous commercial offers at the same 
time.  A standard procurement process for logistics 
services usually includes RFI, RFQ or RFP and through 
a systematic framework that helps streamline the entire 
procurement lifecycle, from identifying needs to contract 
closure. By defining clear steps and responsibilities, 
organizations can reduce duplication of efforts, minimize 
delays, and optimize resource allocation to ensure best 
value for money.

A well-designed procurement process enables orga- 
nizations to identify cost-saving opportunities and 
negotiate favorable terms with vendors. By leveraging 
economies of scale, standardizing specifications,  
and conducting competitive bidding processes,  
organizations can achieve cost efficiencies and  
optimize their procurement spent.

This process has been refined with the aim to improve 
standardization and automatization, maximizing 

efficiency and as such when considering the current 
maturity and context of the sustainable logistics, it is 
probably more realistic to consider generating incremental 
improvement in terms of Sustainability. Indeed, the 
transactional process will face limitation in terms of  
the agility and resources to adapt to the changes driven 
by more substantial sustainability improvements.

Throughout the transactional procurement process, 
organizations may follow established policies,  
procedures, and guidelines to ensure transparency, 
accountability, and compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements. Additionally, organizations may use 
procurement software or systems to streamline and 
automate various aspects of the procurement process, 
enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.

The current process for procuring commodity goods 
and services is well-established, yet adjustments are 
needed to address the challenges outlined earlier. 
Subsequently, necessary changes will be outlined to 
ensure alignment of this process with its new purpose. 

3.2 The Transformational approach

Transformational initiatives, in contrast to transactional 
ones, typically occur outside the established procurement 
processes. These initiatives are driven by the objective 
of achieving significant progress in reducing carbon 
emissions within a single project, often leading to profound 
and far-reaching changes in existing operational 
processes. Transformational initiatives are those that 
aim to bring about substantial and groundbreaking 
changes, while transactional initiatives focus on routine 
or day-to-day processes and activities. In the context of 
GHG emissions reduction, transformational initiatives 
seek to make a significant impact.

Transformational initiatives may not follow the usual 
procurement procedures but should be approached 
with a collaborative project management mindset.  
They might involve alternative approaches to sourcing 
and acquiring the necessary resources and technologies. 
Transformational initiatives are expected to cause 
profound changes in how an organization operates. 
These changes could affect everything from supply 
chains and production processes to energy usage and 
waste management. Transformational initiatives in the 
context of GHG emissions reduction are strategic 

3. Types of collaboration between shippers and LSPs 
20

efforts to make significant changes to operational 
processes and practices outside the typical procurement 
process. These initiatives aim to have a deep and 
lasting impact on an organization’s carbon footprint  
and environmental sustainability. Traditionally,  

Transformational initiatives leverage unique solutions  
or latest technologies available to yield high-GHG 
emissions reductions. However, these solutions are  
not yet fully developed, and it can be a competitive 
endeavor to secure best in class solutions.

Freight buyers should combine both approaches based 
on their ambitions and resources available. While 
successful transformational initiatives would result in 
higher GHG emissions reductions than a transactional 
approach, the requirement in terms of times and 
resources are much higher as well. As such, it may not 
be realistic for an organization to plan transformational 
initiatives for all their shipments. A balance between 
high sustainability targets and business continuity should 
be struck, based on the available resources, it is likely 
that only part of the transports will be concerned by  

the reduction generated by the transformational 
initiative and a more standardized approach would be 
required to ensure the remaining freight is still serviced.  
Consequently, it is key to assess transformational 
initiatives to select projects which are ambitious, 
realistic and for which there are sufficient resources 
available. The transactional approach, thanks to the 
recommendations highlighted in this playbook, will  
help procure sustainable logistics services through a 
standardized process. 

3. Types of collaboration between shippers and LSPsThere can be several reasons why a company may 
choose to apply a conventional procurement process 
instead of an innovative and collaborative process to 
choose its suppliers of low GHG emissions logistics 
services, such as:

•    Familiarity and risk mitigation: Conventional 

procurement processes are often well-established 
and familiar to companies. They follow a structured 
and predictable approach, which can help mitigate 
risks associated with supplier selection. Companies 
may prefer to stick to what they know works rather 
than experimenting with new and untested methods.

•    Time and resource constraints: Implementing an 
innovative and collaborative procurement process 
requires time, effort, and resources. This may 
involve conducting extensive market research, 
engaging in collaborative discussions with potential 
suppliers, and evaluating unconventional criteria. In 
some cases, companies may not have the bandwidth 
or resources available to invest in such an elaborate 
process.

•    Supplier stability and reliability: Conventional 

procurement processes often prioritize stability  
and reliability in supplier selection. By following 
established guidelines and standards, companies 
can choose suppliers with a proven track record  
and established reputation. This can be particularly 
important in industries where logistics services  
are critical to the company’s operations.

•    Cost considerations: Conventional procurement 

processes can be designed to focus on cost optimi-
zation. By using standardized evaluation criteria  
and competitive bidding, companies can compare 
suppliers more easily based on price. This approach 
may be suitable when cost efficiency is the primary 
concern.

21

3.4 How to decide the right mix 
between the approaches
To evaluate which approach is more relevant for a given 
market and context, procurement should assess the 
strategic importance of the logistics solutions against 
the availability of said solutions in each market. This 
can be evaluated along two axes: 

•    Strategic importance: Assessing which sourcing 
approach to take requires understanding of the 
importance of the emissions and logistics to your 
business. Examples of strategic importance: 
•  Significant share of emissions are from this  
   specific mode or supplier 
•  The consequences for not changing are prohibitive  
   or costly.   
•  The wider business implications of the desired  

logistics change for the company

•    Market opportunities: The market opportunities 

reflect the ability of the market to supply low carbon 
logistics. The company must understand the market 
opportunities, or more specifically, the availability  
of reliable carbon emissions reduction solutions in 
each market.  
•  If market opportunity is low to non-existent, a  
   freight buyer needs to consider how to transform  
   their own operations or take a transformational  
   approach in collaboration with their service  
   providers. 
•  If market opportunity is significant, a freight buyer  
   needs to consider how to include sustainability  
   within their transactional procurement process.

There are three key themes to evaluate when assessing the market opportunities:

1.  Potential capabilities of suppliers and scalability of the solutions available

•  

•  

•  

•  

GHG emissions reduction potential: What is the % of emissions that can be reduced?

Key reduction potential availability ( >x%): Where and how many solutions are available?

Consolidation potential: How many suppliers are able to provide these solutions?

Reporting capacity: What is the capacity of the suppliers to report on the impact?

2.  Financial and carbon impact of the solutions available

•  

•  

•  

Insight into the relationship between cost and sustainable performance: What is the cost structure and  
premium structure behind the sustainability?

Investment capabilities: What are the CAPEX cost considerations?

Scope attractiveness: How attractive is the solution to your customers?

3.  Business risks & operational impact of the solutions available

•  

•  

•  

Operational alignment: What is the impact on business infrastructure and processes?

Emissions scope control: Is the emissions reductions within control of your suppliers?

Overall sustainability strategy: Is your supplier in line with your sustainability strategy?

And of course, the existence of a market that can deliver GHG emissions services needs to be in place. 

To help navigate and provide a systematic approach to the evaluation of the market opportunities, an example of  
a Logistics Industry Sustainable Maturity Matrix has been created. This example is available in Annex 1.

4.1 Intervention 1. Sourcing and 
procurement strategy

A clear sourcing strategy empowers logistics  
professionals to optimize costs, improve service  
levels, mitigate risks, enhance visibility and control,  
as well as foster collaboration and innovation with 
logistics service providers.

4.1.1  Set boundaries and goals (Step 1)

A sourcing strategy is essential when buying logistics 
services for a range of reasons.

•   Optimization: A sourcing strategy enables businesses 
to identify cost-effective logistics service providers. 

•   Risk mitigation: Logistics services play a critical 

role in the supply chain, and disruptions or failures 
can have a significant impact on a company’s 
operations. A sourcing strategy helps in diversifying  
the provider base, establishing backup options,  

and implementing risk management measures  
to mitigate potential risks and ensure business 
continuity.

•   Scalability and flexibility: As businesses change 

and their logistics requirements evolve, a sourcing 
strategy allows for scalability and flexibility. Key to a 
successful procurement is to understand the market 
landscape and engage a network of logistics providers.

•   Innovation and continuous improvement: A sourcing 
strategy encourages businesses to actively engage 
with logistics service providers, fostering collaboration 
and innovation. By seeking out new technologies, 
processes, and best practices, companies can 
enhance their supply chain efficiency, reduce lead 
times, and stay competitive in a dynamic market.

26

4.1.2  What needs to change?

If you wish to include decarbonization in your sourcing 
strategy, there are several factors to consider:

•   Assessing carbon footprint: Assess your current 
carbon footprint and identify the major sources of 
emissions within your logistics operations. 

•   Setting clear goals and targets: Establish specific 
goals and targets for reducing carbon emissions  
in your sourcing strategy. 

•   Identifying low carbon alternatives: Evaluate and 
identify low carbon alternatives for various aspects 
of your logistics operations. This could involve 
exploring options such as electric vehicles,  
hybrid vehicles, biofuels, rail transport, or other 
sustainable modes of transportation. Consider  
the availability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness  
of these alternatives.

•   Engaging with your suppliers: Encourage your 

suppliers to adopt sustainable practices; collaborate 
to identify ways to reduce emissions throughout  
the supply chain.

•   Investing in infrastructure and technology: Depending 
on your specific logistics requirements, you may 
need to invest in new infrastructure and technologies 
to support decarbonization efforts. 

•   Monitoring and reporting: Implement robust  

monitoring and reporting mechanisms to track 
progress toward your decarbonization goals. 

•   Training and awareness: Provide training and 
awareness programs for your employees and 
suppliers to educate them about the importance  
of decarbonization and the changes being  
implemented in the sourcing strategy. 

•   Obtaining buy-in from senior management:  

Present the business case to justify the actions 
undertaken, including the possibility to not prioritize 
cost as the most important decision criteria. 

•   Establishing an award scheme: Establish  

individual staff KPIs toward sustainability and 
introduce incentives, bonuses and clear recognition  
for logistics and sustainability professionals.  
Consider an award mechanism for your  
suppliers.

4.1.3  How to change your sourcing strategy?

Adapting your sourcing strategy is likely the most challenging yet crucial task out of the six interventions, as 
developing a roadmap to procure zero emissions logistics requires to involve various field of expertise and the 
evaluation of multiple factors. Figure 16 presents an example of sourcing strategy revision.

4.1.4  Details of what needs to change

Step 1. Outline Current Strategy  
What is our target, roadmap, and how to achieve this? Which areas will we prioritize and which suppliers?  
Through defining the overall strategy, we can choose:

Step 2. Frame Strategic Issue  
How might we ensure access to sufficient low-GHG emissions logistics services to support our growth and  
decarbonization at the same time? Issues emerging are:

Frame Strategic Issue

Deliver on current projects (short term):  
How might we deliver on our current  
low-GHG emissions targets?

•     We see capacity and capability issues with the current LSPs within the current  

    timeframe. 

•     How might we attract a higher share of the low-GHG emissions offers currently  

    available?

Track the agreed emissions reduction: 
How might we monitor that the agreed  
emissions reductions are taking place?

•     How do we confirm that our suppliers are delivering the agreed emissions reductions? 
•     Is our current emissions performance aligned with our interim goals? 

Ensure long-term capacity:  
How might we ensure long-term  
supplier capacity?

•     From a buyer’s market to more of a supplier’s market. How do we create value for  

    our suppliers? 

•     Are we satisfied with the main suppliers that currently service our business? 

Ensure supplier capabilities:  
How might we align supplier capabilities  
with the current and future requirements?

•    Suppliers need our support to upgrade their processes or temporarily adjust our   
      requirements. 
•    New suppliers with the required capabilities may need to be included in our pool  

   of carriers. 

•    How do we reward suppliers?

Support sustainable investment:  
How might we reduce the cost of current  
and future operations?

•    Have we identified candidates for a long-term partnership to support low-GHG emissions 

   solution development? 

•    What cost levers are relevant? How can we leverage our scale? How do LSPs  

   define value? 

Develop learnings:  
How might we improve our knowledge of  
low-GHG emissions solutions?

•    Develop knowledge and maturity of new low-GHG emissions solutions. 
•    Ensure that new knowledge is leveraged in future procurement activities. 

Early tech adoption rendered obsolete: 
How might we mitigate the suppliers’ risk  
of being technologically stranded?

•    With the strong development of sustainable transport solutions, there is a risk  

   of stranded assets. 

•    How can we foster carrier confidence in investing in low-GHG emissions solutions? 

Reach end goal:  
How might we ensure a smooth path  
toward our 2050 target?

•    There is a strong difference in terms of decarbonizing ambitions and sustainable  

   roadmaps between our suppliers.

Step 3. Generate options (per issue):  
Durig this phase, we will pinpoint potential solutions 
that could address the strategic issues identified 
earlier. This process should be carried out for each  
of the issues raised in step 2.

Step 4. Identify barriers to choices (per options):  
What limits each solution and approach we can take, 
recognizing the above considerations.

Step 5. Test and choose:  
Select the solution and choose our approach.

Step 6. Adjust to new strategy:  
Refresh strategy and reiterate.

4.2 Intervention 2. Specification

4.2.1  What do we want to achieve?

An accurate, cost efficient, quality assured, standardized 
specification that helps ensure suppliers understand 
the exact requirements of the logistics procurement 
process. The specification will provide a basis in 
evaluating suppliers and mitigating risks, enabling 
quality and clarity for procurement professionals.

4.2.2  What needs to change?

A logistics service provider needs a clear specification 
from buyers to understand the requirements and 
expectations for the services they are being contracted  
to provide.

Clear specifications help to ensure that the service 
provider understands the scope of the project, the 
desired outcomes, and the performance metrics that 
will be used to measure success. It can help to prevent 
misunderstandings or miscommunications that could 
lead to delays, increased costs, or other issues.

Additionally, clear specifications can help to ensure that 
the service provider is able to deliver solutions that 
meet the specific needs of the buyer, which can help  
to improve customer satisfaction and build long-term 
relationships.

4.2.3  What needs to change?

4.2.4  Changing the specifications

To change your specification, there are four recommen-
dations to make:

•   Identify key areas for decarbonization: Assess the 
logistics operations and identify areas where decar-
bonization measures can be implemented. This may 
include transportation modes, packaging materials, 
energy usage, waste management, and supplier 
selection.

•   Establish decarbonization objectives: Set clear 

objectives and targets for decarbonization within the 
logistics procurement process. These objectives should 
align with the organization’s decarbonization goals.

•   Develop decarbonization guidelines: Consider 

referring to the Smart Freight Procurement Question- 
naire to create standard guidelines that outline the 
specific decarbonization measures required from 
suppliers. These guidelines should cover key areas 
such as emissions reduction, sustainable packaging, 
transportation efficiency, and waste management 
practices. 

•   Include decarbonization requirements in RFQs and 
RFPs: Modify the request for quotations (RFQs) and 
request for proposals (RFPs) templates used in the 
procurement process to include specific decarbon-
ization requirements using the Smart Freight  
Procurement Questionnaire. This may involve adding 
sections or questions related to decarbonization 
practices, emissions reduction plans, or environmental 
certifications. In order to clearly define requirements, 
a common language and standards are necessary. 
As previously mentioned, shippers and LSPs have 
encountered difficulties in communicating sustainable 
expectations due to varying approaches and reporting 
requirements. 

There are a series of specifications to be made, which 
need to be included in any tender specification. In order 
of increasing complexity are the following:

Emissions reporting requirements

Emissions performance requirements

Emissions reporting requirements: While procurement 
and use of logistics services has always involved a 
certain amount of data exchange, the inclusion of 
sustainability as a performance indicator of logistics 
services has substantially raised the need for visibility 
and information exchange. The emergence of a set of 
standards or methodologies, building upon ISO 14083, 
suggests that shippers could become more prescriptive 
regarding their requirements and expectations for 
reporting and calculation. This could involve considering 
the overall market maturity and the progress of each 

supplier in their sustainable journey. There’s a possibility 
of having tiered expectations based on maturity and a 
roadmap for rapid enhancement of capabilities.

With a common language and standards established  
to define the sustainable requirements, it becomes 
essential to grasp the scope of these requirements and 
the approach to specify sustainable logistics services. 
This includes the standards, the data requirements,  
the frequency and the targets set for suppliers.

Emissions performance related requirements:  
To address the complexity of specifying sustainable 
performance for logistics services, shippers have the 
option to characterize their requirements in terms of 

input or outcome. Therefore, the focus should be on 
clearly defining expectations regarding assets or energy 
to be used, or the anticipated results and outcomes.

4. Updating the transactional procurement process32

•   Outcome-based contracting is a type of contractual 
arrangement where the potential incentives and 
penalties are based on the successful completion  
of the delivery of the operational requirements  
and meeting certain performance metrics, rather 
than the inputs or resources used to complete the 
project. Under this type of contract, the contractor  
is rewarded based on the achievement of specific 
outcomes, such as meeting decarbonization targets.

  This approach is designed for high performance  

and increased transparency. While it involves a high 
level of supplier expertise and an engagement in  
a long-term relationship, it translates to a more 
streamlined performance evaluation.

  Suppliers have a large span of control and larger 

allocation of risk and responsibility. This approach 
requires adjustment of payment mechanisms as well.

Example

Performance requirements for a logistics service company delivering low-GHG emissions services include metrics related 
to reducing GHG emissions and baseline performance. LSPs could either use low-emission vehicles, optimize delivery 
routes to minimize fuel consumption and/or implement sustainable practices in their operations to meet the required target. 

Specific performance metrics therefore focus on reducing GHG emissions regardless of the type of logistics services. The 
contract may also include penalties for failing to meet these performance requirements and incentives for exceeding 
them. Realizing that not all logistics service providers will be able to deliver this from year 1, there might be a need to 
specify an improvement path and agree on incentive and penalty schemes for these improvements. 

•   Input-based contracting is a type of contractual 
arrangement where the method of execution is 
prescribed specifically. Under this type of contract, 
potential incentives or penalties are based on the 
quantity of the resources used, aligning with the 
required specification, such as labor, materials, and 
equipment, rather than fully relying on meeting 
certain performance metrics. 

  This is used when a buyer has a high level of  

expertise, strong fact-based data foundation and 
advanced monitoring and control can be observed. 

Example

The level of performance may vary as a result of the 
inputs specified.

  Freight buyers have a large span of control and take 
the risk and responsibility of the specified require-
ments. While performance assessment might be 
difficult in some context, this approach allows for  
a more transactional relation. It is to be noted that 
by dictating the required equipment to the LSP,  
a shipper may miss out on the suppliers’ full  
capabilities.

Specify what the suppliers must do to deliver performance according to the standards, such as: 
•  Specifying the assets and engines the service provider must operate 
•  Specifying the type of fuel  
•  Specifying the way you want the operator to operate when servicing your operations 
•  Specifying how suppliers should use renewable energy in their operations

33

4.3 Intervention 3. RFI & RFP

 •   Emissions reporting requirements: Request 

4.3.1  What do we want to achieve?

The objective is to identify qualified service providers, 
obtain information and receive detailed proposals 
through clear and understandable RFI, RFQ and RFP 
documents, ensuring both buyer and service provider 
have a clear understanding of the scope, requirements, 
and expectations of the project.

4.3.2  Why do we need RFI/RFP?

A logistics service provider needs a clear RFI and RFP 
or RFQ from buyers to understand the buyer’s needs 
and requirements, and to provide an accurate and 
competitive proposal for the services they are being 
contracted to provide. 

An RFI may be used to gather information about the 
buyer’s needs and preferences, while an RFP is typically 
used to request a formal proposal and pricing for 
specific services.

Clear RFI and RFP documents ensure that the service 
provider understands the scope of the project, the 
desired outcomes, and the performance metrics that 
will be used to measure success, which can help to 
prevent misunderstandings or miscommunications that 
could lead to delays, increased costs, or other issue.

4.3.3  What needs to change?

Any RFI and RFP seeking to include sustainability 
needs to include the following:

1.   Introduction and background to include your 
targets and commitment: Include a section in  
the documents that clearly communicates your 
organization’s commitment to decarbonization. 
Explain the importance of reducing GHG emissions 
in your supply chain and the goals you aim to 
achieve through the procurement processes.

2.   Sustainability criteria: Introduce specific decar-
bonization criteria that suppliers must address  
in their responses. For example, you could ask 
suppliers to provide information on their GHG 
emissions reduction initiatives, commitment to 
using low-GHG emissions transport options or use  
of renewable energy sources in their operations. 
These criteria will help you assess suppliers’ 
alignment with your decarbonization goals.

suppliers to provide data on their GHG emissions 
and their plans for emissions reduction according 
to the previously selected standards and an 
harmonized methodology. This information will 
help you assess the environmental performance 
of potential suppliers and compare their 
sustainability efforts. Consider asking for 
emissions intensities, fuel sources, and overall 
transport activity data related to your operations 
and any other relevant aspects of their operations.

 •   Emissions performance requirements: Encourage 
or mandate suppliers to propose innovative 
low-GHG solutions in their responses. Ask them 
to outline their strategies for reducing emissions.

3.   Supplier collaboration: Emphasize the importance of 
supplier collaboration in achieving decarbonization 
goals. Ask for information on how suppliers plan to 
work with your organization to reduce emissions 
throughout the supply chain.

4.   Evaluation criteria: Modify the evaluation criteria  
in your documents to give appropriate weight  
to sustainability and decarbonization factors.  
This will ensure that suppliers’ efforts to reduce 
GHG emissions are considered alongside other 
transactional procurement criteria, such as cost, 
quality, and reliability.

5.   Performance monitoring: Include sustainability 
provisions for ongoing performance monitoring 
and reporting in the contract or agreement with 
suppliers. Specify the information you expect 
suppliers to provide on a regular basis, such as 
emissions data, progress on decarbonization 
targets or updates on new initiatives. This will 
enable you to track suppliers’ performance  
over time and ensure ongoing adherence to the 
decarbonization goals (see also intervention 6).

To effectively assess the sustainability performance  
of the service providers’ offers in the RFP process, 
Procurement should focus on sharing expectations  
and requirements aligned with the chosen specification 
approach. This could be either input-based requirements 
or outcome-based requirements.

4.4 Intervention 4. Evaluation

4.4.1  What do we want to achieve?

The buyers of logistics services wish to achieve several 
objectives when evaluating an RFI, RFQ, or RFP. These 
objectives may include identifying potential suppliers 
who can meet their specific needs and requirements,  
comparing pricing and service offerings across multiple 
suppliers, assessing the quality and reliability of the 
suppliers services, and ensuring compliance with 
regulatory and environmental standards.

4.4.2  Why do we need an Evaluation?

The buyer of logistics services needs to do an evaluation 
of the RFI, RFP, and RFQ to ensure that they select the 
most suitable supplier who can meet their specific 
needs and requirements. 

This evaluation allows the buyer to compare the offerings 
of multiple suppliers, assess the quality and reliability 
of their services, and determine which supplier offers 
the best value for their money. 

Additionally, the evaluation ensures that the selected 
supplier is compliant with regulatory and environmental 
standards and can provide innovative solutions to 
improve the buyer’s logistics operations. Ultimately,  

the evaluation process is essential for the buyer to 
make an informed decision and select the most suitable 
supplier for their logistics needs.

4.4.3   What needs to change in the evaluation?

If the buyer starts to evaluate GHG emissions in  
addition to cost, reliability, and performance when 
evaluating logistics service suppliers, then the  
selection criteria and evaluation process would  
need to be updated. 

The buyer would need to set specific performance metrics 
related to reducing GHG emissions and incorporate them 
into the evaluation criteria. This could include requiring 
suppliers to provide data on their GHG emissions, 
assessing the use of low-emissions fuels and vehicles  
and sustainable practices, and considering the supplier’s 
commitment to reducing their GHG footprint.

The evaluation process would need to prioritize suppliers 
who demonstrate a strong commitment to decarbonization 
and provide innovative solutions for reducing emissions 
in the logistics industry.

4. Updating the transactional procurement process 
 
35

Figure 21: Standard criteria for assessing logistics service providers, not yet considering sustainability

While the specific criteria may vary depending on the industry and the organization’s needs, here are ten major criteria  
commonly used for evaluating logistics service providers:
1 Reliability

Procurement professionals assess the reliability of logistics service providers by examining their track  
record of on-time deliveries and their ability to meet agreed-upon service level agreements (SLAs).

2 Cost effectiveness

The cost effectiveness of a logistics service provider is evaluated by considering the overall pricing structure, 
including transport costs, warehousing fees and any additional charges. Procurement professionals aim to 
strike a balance between cost and quality of service.

3 Service quality

The quality of service provided by a logistics service provider is assessed by metrics such as order accuracy, 
inventory management, responsiveness to inquiries and customer satisfaction levels.

4 Global capabilities

5 Technology and 
 innovation

6 Scalability and  
flexibility

For organizations with international operations or supply chains, the logistics service provider’s global capabilities 
are crucial. This criterion evaluates the provider’s network, infrastructure and expertise in managing cross-border 
logistics.

Procurement professionals assess the reliability of logistics service providers by examining their track  
record of on-time deliveries and their ability to meet agreed-upon service level agreements (SLAs).

As businesses grow or face fluctuations in demand, logistics service providers must demonstrate the ability 
to scale their operations accordingly. Procurement professionals evaluate providers based on their flexibility 
to adapt to changing business needs.

7 Compliance and risk 
management

Logistics service providers must adhere to regulatory requirements and manage risks effectively. Procure-
ment professionals assess the provider’s compliance track record, certifications, safety procedures and risk 
mitigation strategies.

8 Sustainability and  

environmental impact

With increasing focus on sustainability, procurement professionals may evaluate logistics service providers 
based on their commitment to environmentally friendly practices, such as GHG emissions footprint reduction, use 
of alternative fuels and waste management. Most organizations have some of these criteria already included in 
the evaluation - but would need to increase the extent of the evaluation and the importance of the criteria.

9 Financial stability

The financial stability of a logistics service provider is assessed to ensure its long-term viability. Procurement  
professionals may review the provider’s financial statements, credit ratings and overall financial health.

10 References and  
reputation

Procurement professionals seek references and evaluate a logistics service provider’s reputation in the 
industry. They may consider customer testimonials, case studies and industry awards to gauge the provider’s 
credibility and track record.

An evaluation model for low-GHG emissions logistics 
would include specific performance metrics related to 
reducing GHG emissions, such as using alternative 
fuels and low-emissions vehicles, optimizing delivery 
routes to minimize fuel consumption, and implementing 
sustainable practices in operations.

The evaluation model would prioritize suppliers that 
demonstrate a strong commitment to decarbonization 
and provide innovative solutions for reducing emissions.

The evaluation model would also consider the supplier’s 
track record in improving GHG emissions efficiency and 
its ability to meet regulatory and environmental standards.

In addition, the evaluation model may include penalties for 
failing to meet decarbonization performance requirements 
and incentives for exceeding them. Overall, the goal  
of the evaluation model is to select a supplier that can 
provide high-quality, cost-effective logistics services 
while reducing GHG emissions and promoting  
sustainability.

It is difficult to compare suppliers based on decarbon-
ization evaluation criteria only aas such additional 
insights are needed on how to weigh GHG emissions  
in an evaluation matrix. There are two overarching 
strategies that can be considered in this context:

1.   Multicriteria: Utilizing a % allocation of emissions 
vis-à-vis other criteria such as costs, speed and 
reliability. This can take the form of a % allocation 
to each criteria and proposals receive a scoring for 
each criteria and ranked in accordance to this.  

2.   Quantifying the cost of carbon: Carbon pricing 
mechanism is a well-known strategy which 
includes a price (actual or shadow) to the absolute 
emissions incurred. This should be in the range of 
100 USD+ to become significant. 

Which solution or mechanism to choose depends on 
several local and company-specific factors. The study 
“Putting a Price on Carbon” by CDP offers concrete 
example of CO2e valuation, providing the 2020 average 
per industry in its annex.

4. Updating the transactional procurement process36

Hence, it is suggested to incorporate the following 
evaluation and maturity model into the existing evalua-
tion models in use:

1.   Commitment: To what extent do suppliers have 
existing commitments, pledges and targets in 
place?

2.   Transparency: To what extent are suppliers able  
to report and demonstrate progress toward an 
emissions reduction plan?

3.   Operational targets: To what extent are suppliers 
able to meet our specific operational performance 
targets (e.g. input-based or outcome-based 
contracting)?

4.   Data sharing: To what extent are suppliers able  
to exchange data with us and demonstrate 
improvements in data quality?

5.   Innovation and leadership: To what extent do 

suppliers have a continuous improvement mindset 
and a desire to innovate?

Box. Evaluating the ROI of a fuel switch with a carbon pricing mechanism

While an approach has been devised to assess sustainability in logistics services procurement, the capability to analyze  
the relationship between cost and sustainability is currently restricted in the absence of clear cost structures. Recently, 
commodity platforms have emerged providing financial insights for standard fuels and now including daily rates for 
alternative fuels as well. It is anticipated that as this trend gains traction, a consensus on alternative fuel rates will be 
established. This will enable procurement professionals to access cost and rate references for each fuel type and forecast 
future trends akin to diesel rates.

Once shippers and logistics service providers reach consensus on specific rates or an established database for fuel adjust-
ments, visibility into the costs associated with sustainable transport offers against emissions reduction can be leveraged  
for any type of logistics services where switching to alternative fuel is considered.

New shipping rate

=     Service rate traditional fuel + Service rate traditional fuel * Energy share traditional fuel

*

(

)

Applying the formula provided above allows to project the anticipated service rate based on the utilization of the new fuel and 
its associated costs. It is crucial to note that this formula doesn’t account for potential effects of operational impacts, such as 
extended transit times or waiting times. Thus, it’s intended specifically for comparing energy or fuel switches in scenarios 
where there are no operational impacts.

With the new energy profile utilized, the forecasted GHG emissions reduction resulting from the switch can be determined.

4.5 Intervention 5. Contracting

4.5.1  What do we want to achieve?

Establish a legally binding relationship between buyers 
and sellers that protects both entities throughout the 
procurement process and contract duration.

4.5.2  Why do we need contracting?

1.   Legal protection: Contracts provide a legal 

framework that outlines the rights, obligations, 
and responsibilities of both the procurement 
professional and the logistics service provider. 

2.   Service level agreement (SLA): Contracts often 

include a Service Level Agreement that defines the 
expected level of service and performance metrics 
that the logistics service provider must meet. This 
ensures that the procurement professional receives 
the agreed-upon quality of service and can hold the 
provider accountable if there are any deviations.

3.   Cost and pricing: Contracts specify the pricing 
structure, payment terms, and any additional 
charges or penalties. This helps the procurement 
professional understand the costs associated with 
the logistics services and ensures transparency in 
financial transactions.

4.   Scope of services: Contracts clearly define the 

scope of services provided by the logistics service 
provider. This includes the specific logistics 
activities, such as transportation, warehousing, 
inventory management, and any value-added 
services. 

5.   Risk mitigation: Contracts often include clauses 
related to risk allocation and liability. This helps 
mitigate risks associated with loss or damage of 
goods, delays, disruptions, or any other issues that 
may arise during the logistics process. 

6.   Confidentiality and intellectualproperty:  

Contracts may include provisions to protect  
confidential information and intellectual property 
shared between the procurement professional  
and the logistics service provider. 

7.   Termination and exit strategy: Contracts outline the 
terms and conditions for termination or renewal of 
the agreement. This provides a structured process for 
both parties to exit the contract if needed, including 
any notice periods, obligations and procedures for 
transitioning to another service provider.

4.5.3  What needs to change?

1.   Decarbonization objectives: The contract should 
clearly state the procurement professional’s 
environmental objectives related to decarboniza-
tion, such as reducing GHG emissions, or achieving 
specific environmental targets. 

2.   Performance metrics: The contract should  
include specific performance metrics (KPIs) 
related to decarbonization. For example, the 
logistics service provider may be required to  
report on their GHG emissions, energy consumption, 
or use of alternative fuels. The KPIs should be 
measurable and time-bound to track progress  
and hold the provider accountable.

3.   Compliance with environmental regulations:  

The contract should specify that the logistics 
service provider must comply with all relevant 
environmental regulations and standards related  
to decarbonization.

4.   Reporting and transparency: The contract should 
outline the logistics service provider’s reporting 
obligations regarding their decarbonization  
efforts. This may include regular reporting on  
GHG emissions.

5.   Collaboration and innovation: The contract should 
encourage collaboration and innovation between 
the procurement professional and the logistics 
service provider to achieve decarbonization  
goals. This can include provisions for sharing  
best practices, exploring new technologies or  
processes, and jointly developing sustainability 
initiatives.

4. Updating the transactional procurement process38

6.   Continuous improvement: The contract should 

emphasize the logistics service provider’s commit-
ment to continuous improvement in decarbonization 
efforts. This may involve regular reviews, performance 
assessments, and the implementation of corrective 
actions to achieve ongoing reductions in GHG  
emissions and environmental impact.

7.   Transition and scalability: If the procurement 
professional plans to transition to low-GHG  
emissions logistics operations in the future,  
the contract should address the logistics service 
provider’s ability to support such transitions. This 
may include provisions for scalability, flexibility, and 
the provider’s readiness to adopt new technologies 
or processes as the procurement professional’s 
decarbonization strategy evolves.

8.   Contract duration and renewal: The contract 

should consider the duration of the agreement and 
the potential for renewal. As decarbonization 
efforts evolve rapidly, it may be beneficial to have 
shorter contract durations with opportunities for 

regular evaluation and adjustment of decarbonization 
requirements. In contrast, LSPs may require 
longer contracts to gain certainty in the business 
case of decarbonization.

4.5.4  Changing the contracts – 
Examples of contract language

When drafting the contract, it is important that the 
language aligns closely with the requirements specified, 
to avoid confusion as well as to clearly define the 
expectations from both parties and how it will be 
controlled. 

The clauses presented as examples have been graciously 
provided by the legal firm specializing in green transition.

4.6 Intervention 6. Performance 
management

4.6.1  What do we want to achieve?

Implementing strong performance and contract manage-
ment with logistics service providers allows procurement 
professionals to achieve service level adherence, cost 
savings, risk mitigation, continuous improvement, and 
contractual compliance. 

4.6.2  Why do we need performance 
management?

Quality control: Monitoring the performance of logistics 
service providers allows procurement professionals to 
ensure that the quality of service meets the required 
standards. By monitoring key performance indicators 
(KPIs) such as on-time delivery, accuracy, and customer 
satisfaction, professionals can identify any issues or 
deviations from the agreed-upon service levels.

Cost optimization: Monitoring performance helps 
identify inefficiencies and areas of improvement within the 
logistics service provider’s operations. This information 
can be used to negotiate better pricing, optimize routes, 
reduce transportation costs, and eliminate unnecessary 
expenses, ultimately resulting in cost savings for the 
company.

Risk management: Logistics operations involve various 
risks, such as delays, damage, or disruptions. By 
monitoring performance, procurement professionals 
can identify any potential risks or issues and take 
proactive measures to mitigate them. This includes 
ensuring compliance with safety regulations, monitoring 
insurance coverage, and addressing any operational 
vulnerabilities that may impact the supply chain.

Continuous improvement: Monitoring the performance 
of logistics service providers enables procurement  
professionals to track trends and identify opportunities 
for improvement. By analyzing performance data over  
time, professionals can identify patterns, bottlenecks, or 
areas where service can be enhanced. This information 
can be used to implement process improvements, 
optimize supply chain operations, and enhance overall 
efficiency.

Contract compliance: Logistics service providers 
typically operate based on contractual agreements.  
By monitoring performance, procurement professionals 
can ensure that the service provider is meeting its 
contractual obligations and fulfilling the agreed-upon 
terms and conditions. This includes monitoring service 
levels, compliance with agreed-upon standards, and 
adherence to contractual obligations such as reporting 
requirements or documentation.

4.6.3  What needs to change?

1.   Decarbonization goals: Establish specific  

decarbonization targets. These goals may include 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing 
GHG footprints, or transitioning to GHG emissions  
transportation modes. Set specific, measurable, 
attainable, relevant and time-bound (SMART)  
goals.

2.  Key performance indicators: Introduce new or 

modify existing KPIs to incorporate decarbonization 
metrics. This can include tracking and monitoring 
the GHG emissions associated with transportation 
activities, energy consumption, or the use of 
alternative fuels.

3.   Collaboration and innovation: Foster collaboration 
with logistics service providers to jointly explore and 
implement decarbonization initiatives. This can 
involve working together to identify innovative 
solutions, such as optimizing transportation routes 
to minimize emissions or adopting new technologies 
that support cleaner and more sustainable logistics 
operations. 

4.   Performance incentives: Consider implementing 

performance incentives or contractual agreements 
that reward logistics service providers for achieving 
decarbonization targets. This can include financial 
incentives or preferential treatment for providers 
that demonstrate consistent progress in reducing 
GHG emissions. 

5.   Data transparency and reporting: Emphasize the 
importance of data transparency and reporting 
related to GHG emissions and sustainability metrics. 
Procurement professionals can require logistics 
service providers to provide regular reports on their 
environmental performance, including GHG footprint 
calculations and progress toward decarbonization 
goals. This enables better monitoring, evaluation, 
and improvement of sustainability practices.

6.   Conduct performance reviews: Schedule periodic 
performance reviews with the logistics supplier  
to discuss their performance, review data, and 
address any concerns or areas for improvement. 
These reviews help maintain transparency and 
foster collaboration.

7.   Develop service level agreements (SLAs):  

Create SLAs that outline the specific services to  
be provided by the logistics supplier, along with  
the agreed-upon performance targets and conse-
quences for not meeting them. SLAs help ensure 
clarity and accountability.

8.   Implement performance tracking systems:  

Use technology and systems to track and monitor 
the logistics supplier’s performance against the 
defined KPIs and SLAs. This could involve using 
software, data analysis tools, or automated reporting 
systems.

9.   Regularly measure performance: Continuously 
measure and evaluate the logistics supplier’s 
performance against the established KPIs and SLAs. 
Regular monitoring allows for early identification of 
any deviations or areas needing improvement. 

10. Performance recognition and incentives: Recognize 
and reward the logistics supplier for consistently 
meeting or exceeding performance targets. Provide 
incentives, such as performance-based bonuses or 
long-term contracts, to motivate and maintain high 
levels of performance.

11. Collaborative problem solving: Work together with 
the logistics supplier to address any performance 
issues or challenges that arise. Encourage open 
communication, problem-solving discussions, and 
joint decisionmaking to find mutually beneficial 
solutions.

12. Internal alignment: Harmonize or integrate 

sustainability principles, objectives, and practices 
across various aspects of an organization’s  
operations, strategies, and activities.

13. Provide feedback: Offer constructive feedback to 
the logistics supplier based on the performance 
data and review discussions. Highlight areas of 
strength and identify opportunities for improvement. 
Feedback should be clear, specific, and actionable.

14. Continuous improvement initiatives: Encourage 
the logistics supplier to implement continuous 
improvement initiatives to enhance their performance. 
This could involve process optimization, employee 
training, technology upgrades, or innovation 
projects.

15. Capture all learnings and upgrade processes and 
targets accordingly: Managing sustainable data 
and processes will lead to learnings and insights 
on trends, which need to be documented. Sustainable 
knowledge specific to each organization, created 
this way, would help updating processes and 
reassessing the targets and path forward.

Approach 

5.1 Reasons for a  
transformational approach

There are multiple factors that may lead a company to opt 
for an innovative and collaborative process rather than a 
transactional procurement approach when choosing logistics 
service providers. Here are some potential advantages:

1.  Customized solutions: Conventional procurement 

processes often focus on standardized requirements 
and specifications. In contrast, a transformational 
approach enables companies to work closely with 
suppliers to develop customized logistics solutions 
that meet their specific needs. This can result in more 
efficient and tailored supply chain processes, leading 
to cost savings and improved operational performance.

2.  Improved supplier relationship: An innovative  
and collaborative process allows for closer  
collaboration and engagement with potential 
suppliers. This can lead to stronger relationships 
built on trust, transparency, and shared goals.  
By involving suppliers early in the process,  
companies can tap into their expertise and insights 
to develop more effective logistics solutions.

3.  Continuous improvement: Engaging suppliers in  
an ongoing collaboration fosters an environment of 
continuous improvement. By encouraging suppliers to 
propose innovative ideas and solutions, companies can 
tap into their knowledge and expertise to drive efficiency 
gains and process improvement. This collaborative 
approach can lead to a more agile and responsive 
supply chain that adapts to changing market conditions.

4.  Risk mitigation: Collaborative process allows for  
a deeper understanding of potential risks and 
vulnerabilities throughout the supply chain. By 
involving suppliers in risk assessment and mitigations 
strategies, companies can proactively address 
potential disruptions and develop contingency plans. 
This can help minimize the impact of unforeseen 
events and enhance overall supply chain resilience.

5.  Competitive advantage: Embracing innovation and 
collaboration in supplier selection can provide a  
competitive advantage in the marketplace. By working 
closely with suppliers to develop cutting-edge logistics 
solutions, companies can differentiate themselves from  
competitors and offer unique value proposition to 
customers.  

This can lead to increased customers satisfaction, 
market share and long-term business success.

5.2 Best practices  

Eight best practices have been identified if a buyer and 
a seller wish to pursue a more transformative process:

1.  Clearly identify impact requirements 

  • Identify desired GHG emissions reductions, cost  

  and performance impact measures early. 

  • Define the target state and desired impact of the  
  transformation. How quickly to decarbonize and  
  to what level of ambition? 

  • Break down the target state solution to under 

  stand the GHG emissions reduction requirements  
  in logistics operations.

2.  Create attractive partner value propositions 

  • Acknowledge that partnerships are a two-way  

  street and the need to have highly attractive value  
  propositions for partners. 

3.  Let strategy and market guide 

  • Establish a clear decarbonization strategy with  
  clear ambitions and priorities for the company. 

  • Assess market opportunities and capabilities  
  based on the most relevant evaluation criteria  
  that support the strategy. 

  • Adjust the logistics procurement strategy to  

  match these decisions. 

4.  Integrate elements in partner operating model 

  • Link the overall target state in an operating model  
  to the detailed design of the partner operating  
  model   — together with the possible partners. 

  • Include all relevant operating model dimensions  

  to be as specific as possible.

5.  Settle on preferred partnership model 

7.  Ensure clear partner selection criteria 

  • Explore different partnership models to under 

  stand different ways to decarbonize your logistics.

  • Identify the most relevant models based on your  

  specific requirements.

6.  Take a holistic approach to the business case 

  • Include end-to-end cost, GHG emissions and  

  value elements. 

  • Firmly design and anchor the partner selection  
  criteria that meet the target state, including the  
  ability to meet business and decarbonization  
  requirements. 

8.  Design governance suited for collaboration 

  • Ensure that the collaboration and operations are  
  governed by solid mechanisms/agreements. 

  • Rigorously outline the organizational and  

  • Make sure to incorporate scaling/ramping up of  

  differences when assessing the impact.

5.3 Perspectives on the different
elements of the operating model  

The Transformational approach would most likely lead 
to substantial changes in the supply chain operations 
and the related processes. Hence, it is key to review the 
current logistics operating models against new factors 
and requirements, and define new responsibilities and 
information flow.

It might be required that shippers and LSPs consider 
setting up this operating model in partnership to 
further improve its implementation and impact (See 
Figure 22: Power of One in Section 4.6 Performance 
Management).

Some of the key elements to be considered are  
mentioned below:

•   Process: The processes we use to deliver our 

logistics. Description of the end-to-end processes, 
including the changes required to deliver low/
zero-GHG emission operation. This could include 
manufacturing and distribution network design  
and modalities. 

•   Culture: Cultural traits required from both buyer 

and partners to deliver on decarbonization objectives 
and enable effective collaboration. 

Figure 24: Transformational operating model

•   People and leadership: The capabilities of the buyer 
and partners to deliver reliable logistics services 
and the platforms needed to maintain and develop 
those competences. Includes partner development. 
How are decisions made on a management and daily 
operational level? 

•   Performance management: Clear definition of the 
performance management and review structures 
required to support the desired goals and behaviour. 
Includes measures of operational effectiveness and 
GHG emissions reductions.

•   Technology: The technology needed to deliver GHG 
emissions reductions and service the operations. 
What new systems and legacy systems are required 
to deliver low-GHG emissions solutions? 

•   Organization and governance: The functions  

and structures required in the buyer and partner 
organizations, including appetite and intent to 
collaborate.

6. Conclusion 

47

Where solutions are not yet ready, transformational 
approaches can make significant reductions possible, 
taking a strategic collaborative approach to test, 
evaluate and scale new zero emissions energy and 
adoption of innovations across a supply chain. 

Adjusting the procurement processes can fast track 
these developments and fast track the route to zero 
emissions logistics. It is imperative to integrate  
sustainability within all aspects of logistics services, 
recognizing their inherent value and complexity. 
Choosing the right mix will require assessing the 
strategic importance of the supply chain and the 
opportunities in the market.

While it is possible to integrate sustainability within 
logistics procurement, the successful implementation 
of zero emissions logistics remains a challenging 
exercise and demands a collaborative approach 
between freight buyers and their suppliers. It requires 
understanding how to navigate, respond and adjust  
to each of the dilemmas faced within logistics  
procurement when integrating sustainability. 

Smart Freight Centre will continue to support its 
members and partners in how to navigate, respond  
and adjust their decarbonization strategies, and  
mobilize the logistics ecosystem to track and reduce  
its GHG emissions to achieve 1.5° pathways. 

6. Conclusion

Logistics can decarbonize through taking decisive 
actions. Zero emissions logistics services are entering 
the market and are becoming more readily available. 
However, it is not straightforward and requires  
adjustment to existing procurement processes,  
collaboration with suppliers and the development  
of new procurement and logistics strategies. Through 
this playbook, a comprehensive approach is provided  
to adjust procurement practices across the common 
challenges faced by a freight buyer and a freight 
supplier. 

There are various reasons why a company takes  
such action, including new binding legislation which  
is emerging in many jurisdictions as well as final  
customers demanding transparency over their  
emissions. Companies, and therefore procurement,  
will need to act accordingly. 

This playbook provides an tools for companies to act. 

New contractual models are emerging, enabling the 
inclusion of low and zero emissions logistics within 
transactional logistics. This includes standard 
approaches for carbon reporting in line with the GLEC 
Framework and ISO 14083, and new market approaches 
through a Book and Claim chain of custody which has 
the potential to reshape logistics procurement. As well  
as taking new approaches to input-/ouput-based 
contracting, allowing a service provider to choose low 
carbon modes, increase asset utilization or maximize 
efficiency. As presented in this playbook, all can be 
achieved through including sustainability within the 
existing transactional logistics procurement processes.

7.3 Smart Freight Procurement 
questionnaire manual 

This document includes the Smart Freight Procurement 
Questionnaire (SFP Questionnaire) and provides guidance 
for its usage. The aim is to provide additional insights 
and instructions for companies that want to use the 
SFP Questionnaire, or components of it, in their logistics 
procurement process. If your company is planning to 
incorporate the SFP Questionnaire into your company 
processes, we highly recommend studying this manual 
beforehand. 

This document first presents the broader context and 
scope of the SFP Questionnaire. It then suggests recom-
mendations on the usage and evaluation of the SFP 
Questionnaire, including advice on providing feedback. 
The main part of this document is the Questionnaire 
Manual, which gives crucial information to the buyer 
about the reasons for including the questions and offers 
additional detail to help with answering the questions. 
The questions are listed and the SFP Questionnaire is 
embedded as a download link in the end. 

We will refer to the sender of the questionnaire, the 
questioner, as buyer and to the receiver of the ques-
tionnaire, the respondent, as supplier in the following 
document as this best represents their function in the 
supply chain. 

Context  

Freight-related GHG emissions, with more than 8%, 
make up a substantial part of the total worldwide GHG 
emissions. As a buyer, your influence on these emissions 
can be higher than you might think. Adopting smart 
procurement practices in your logistics operations, 
including any you outsource, can significantly reduce 
your carbon footprint and support the move to a 
greener future. 

However, buyers are often unsure how to assess and 
collaborate with their LSPs and carriers on this topic. 
The result is that LSPs and carriers are confronted  
with an increasing number of non-transparent, 
non-standardized questionnaires. These are often  
no more than an administrative burden, especially 
when there is no feedback or follow up from the 
requesting buyer. 

To reduce this burden SFC has developed a standardized 
questionnaire for buyers of logistics services to assess 

LSPs and carriers during the logistics procurement 
process. SFC has set out to provide a set of appropriate 
questions that are designed to be meaningful for the 
buyer, while being clear and practical for the supplier.  

Target audience 

We have developed this SFP Questionnaire for any type 
of company or organization, irrespective of size, that  
is interested in assessing and evaluating its LSPs and 
carriers during the logistics procurement process.  
To support the adoption of smart freight procurement 
practices, we want to encourage the use of the SFP 
Questionnaire to aid decision-making during the freight 
tender process. 

Scope 

The SFP Questionnaire is designed to assess suppliers 
of logistics services with respect to their behavior and 
capabilities to reduce freight related GHG emissions. 

The SFP Questionnaire covers all transport modes and 
logistics sites across any global logistics supply chain. 

We have taken a general approach but recognize that in 
practical application there will be specific challenges 
for different markets, modes and type of business being 
tendered. 

As a result, we would suggest utilizing additional 
resources, if required, for either more mode-specific 
components (e.g. Clean Cargo, Clean Air Transport or 
industry specific components (e.g. CEFIC SQAS). 

The SFP Questionnaire has been carefully developed to 
consider the most important elements to achieving 
decarbonization and should be used as a general 
assessment on the topic during the freight tender 
process. If the buyer aims to assess other sustainability 
aspects, either environmental components like waste 
management or social sustainability aspects, additional 
resources need to be utilized. 

We acknowledge that there are differences between 
logistics service providers and carriers, due to the size, 
business model and maturity of their organization. 
However, we would encourage the use of as many 
questions as possible and suggest the buyer should 
assess the applicability of certain components  
beforehand. 

 
 
7. Appendix

Structure of the SFP Questionnaire 

The SFP Questionnaire consists of 25 questions for the 
RFI phase and 13 supplementary questions for the RFQ 
phase. Additionally, 8 KPI suggestions are provided for 
use in the contracting phase. The RFI questions are 
predominantly in a Yes / No format. The applicability  
of each question depends on the tendered business,  
so the actual number of questions used is likely to be 
smaller. Additional details are provided in the usage 
and evaluation section. 

The SFP Questionnaire recognizes four main freight 
procurement phases and  aims to supply questions and 
suggestions for each of these phases.

1.      Planning: the preparatory phase, which includes 

the identification of needs, budget definition, a 
project management plan, the identification of 
responsibilities, and a general supplier assessment 
– in line with the organization’s business and 
procurement strategy. 

This is the phase for the RFI questions. These closed

rating and evaluation during the planning process. 

2.     Tendering: tender definition (including procedure, 
award criteria, technical specifications, bidder- 
related aspects, environmental and social 
aspects, financial information, formal aspects), 
public tendering (where applicable) and the  
evaluation of the tenders. 

This is the phase for the RFQ questions. These open 
questions are in a free text format, so companies  
can elaborate on their efforts, to enable a thorough 
assessment during the tendering process. 

3/4. Contracting: the specification of the contract 

terms, supplier selection and contract negotiations, 
agreement on qualitative and quantitative KPIs 
and monitoring activities; the planning phase 
should include early stages of this phase. 

Contract-based supplier management: monitoring of 
supplier performance using qualitative and quantitative 
KPIs. Identifying future improvement areas and best 
practices. 

For these two phases the SFP Questionnaire provides 
KPI suggestions. These KPI suggestions build on the RFI 
and RFQ questions to give guidance on possible KPI 
agreements during the contracting and contract-based 
supplier management phase. It is important that the KPIs 
finally agreed are meaningful and precise and provide 
enough leeway to encourage innovation by suppliers. 

The allocation and structure of the questions follow  
three guiding principles and address the needs of 
organizations: transparency, collaboration, and 
leadership and innovation. A strong smart freight 
procurement process should include at least these 
three guiding principles to reach a complete approach. 
Whereas each principle is important by itself, focusing 
on only one or two will not be as effective in reaching 
maximum impact. Each principle is matched with a 
number of subtopics that describe the question  
component.

Usage and evaluation  

All questions are listed in a separate Excel file, sorted by 
transport modes and the aforementioned procurement 
process phases. 

As stated before, the SFP Questionnaire can be used as 
a whole, or individual components can be used separately, 
based on the application to the tendered business and 
your company’s preferences. A few question components 
(T.4, T.5, T.6, T.7, T.8, T.9, I.5, I.6 and I.7), are transport 
mode specific and are interchangeable depending on 
the transport modes that are requested in your freight 
tender. The Questionnaire Manual below contains 
crucial information on the usage of the questions. 
Certain questions need to be adjusted in their phrasing, 
depending on their applicability. Make sure to adjust 
and include only the relevant components. 

We recommend determining a subset of questions, 
within your question selection, that are conditional. 
These questions should be required to be answered 
positively by the supplier as they reflect the minimum 
levels of engagement and readiness required to meet 
your company’s standards. Additional assistance on this 
can be found in the Questionnaire Manual section of 
this document. 

The Yes / No structure of the RFI questions enables a 
simple assessment of the responders. It also allows 
you to set a minimum threshold, an amount of positive 
answers, that can be used as a qualifier for suppliers in 
order to participate in the subsequent RFQ phase. This 
threshold needs to be determined by your company but 
should reflect a realistic expectation of the relevant 
market maturity on this topic. 

Some questions are crucial and necessary to ask but, in 
your evaluation, you will need to adjust the significance 
of each component to reflect how it contributes to your 
company’s priorities and strategy. This can be achieved 
by giving different weighting to the RFI questions, and 
especially the subsequent RFQ questions. This weighting 
should be done on question and topic level. An example 
can be found in the Excel file. 

The current questionnaire is designed to demonstrate 
the status quo of the supplier. It may be beneficial to 
amend certain questions to allow suppliers who can’t 
currently answer them positively, to demonstrate that 
they are planning to address the component within 12 
months or allow for explanations in case suppliers  
want to justify why certain questions were answered 
negatively. A possible solution is the addition of a 
general comments field. However, you should recognize 
that the above could make comparison between  
suppliers more difficult. 

The SFP Questionnaire doesn’t ask for any document 
uploads or attachments such as certifications or 
sustainability reports. While they can be useful in 
confirming the accuracy of the responses, they primarily 
add to the administrative burden for the supplier and 
require additional effort during the evaluation. 

During a tender process a level of sincerity and trust 
should be in place. However, we do suggest pointing 
out during the RFI process that additional follow up 
questions will be asked in the RFQ process, to avoid 
false promises from the suppliers during the first 
phase.

The internal capabilities and expertise in your company 
to evaluate the questionnaire need to be considered 
beforehand. We would suggest that questions are only 
asked if the following requirements are met: 

1. Relevance to the tendered business 

Depending on the scope of the business being tendered, 
the questionnaire can be used as a whole, or single 
components can be used on their own. Alternatively, 
the questions could be incorporated into your own 
existing questionnaire. Either way, it is important that 
every question that is selected actually matters for your 
decision-making process. 

 
 
7. Appendix

2. Company evaluation process  

Questionnaire Manual 

A general problem with current supplier questionnaires 
is the increasing range of elements included, and the 
specialist knowledge and time required to evaluate 
them fully. We have tried to address this by keeping  
the approach simple but recognize that the degree of 
quality still depends on your internal capabilities. 

3. The likelihood of incorporating new  
solutions/ proposals into your business 
processes 

Certain SFP Questionnaire components ask for specific 
data formats, measures or proposals. These components 
should only be included and taken into consideration if 
your company will respond positively, adhere to the 
higher standard and adopt the proposed measures. 

4. The ability to give feedback to suppliers 

It is crucial that you share your feedback and results 
with all of the participating suppliers to maximize the 
uptake of low emission freight and motivate logistics 
service providers and carriers. 

We would suggest giving feedback in the most detailed 
way possible. LSPs and carriers are often unaware of 
the expectations of their customers and this kind of 
feedback will help guide them toward the measures 
and elements they should be focusing on in their own 
decarbonization strategy. Additionally, if the supplier 
was unable to meet your company’s minimum standards, 
it is crucial for them to understand what they would 
need to do before responding to future RFIs. 

Certain questions and components require a relatively 
high level of maturity on the topic and are included to 
encourage suppliers to make ambitious efforts toward 
decarbonization. Therefore, we have included an 
additional educational component to every topic. This 
“background” information explains the intent of the 
question and provides examples and explanations.  
This information should be included in the SFP  
Questionnaire version you share with the supplier. 
Moreover, we encourage you to assist LSPs and  
carriers that are eager to improve on certain  
components with guidance wherever practicable. 

We strongly recommend reading this manual before 
using the SFP Questionnaire provided, with the questions 
in front of you. The manual offers an explanation as to 
why certain questions are asked (or not asked), the way 
they are asked, and what additional details might be 
useful. Our aim is to create questions which are 
straightforward, clear and reflect a direct impact for 
your business, rather than just a check for general 
capabilities. The answers to these questions imply a  
lot about the supplier, even if a simple Yes / No format 
is used. With this, we want to make the assessment as 
meaningful as possible. 

For each topic background information is provided for 
both buyer and supplier, as well as additional advice  
for the buyer. 

Background information is included for each topic  
in the SFP Questionnaire to explain the context, and 
examples are provided for clarity. This information 
should be shared with the supplier that receives the 
SFP Questionnaire to increase the understanding and 
acceptance of the question as well as the quality of the 
answers. 

Additional advice is provided to assist the buyer and is 
not included in the SFP Questionnaire. This information 
is designed to outline the added value that the component 
can deliver to the decision-making process and possible 
interpretations of the answers that are provided, as well 
as the limitations in the questions. 

The table also contains the aforementioned KPI sug-
gestions for the contract-based supplier management 
phase. These are added at the end of each guiding 
principle and relate to a specific topic and question.  
It is important that the KPIs finally agreed are  
meaningful and precise and provide enough leeway  
to encourage innovation by suppliers.

Transparency  

This category aims to assess the degree to which the supplier has tackled the topic of decarbonization on a strategic level and what ground-
work in terms of targets and GHG emission calculation capabilities has already been done.

Topic

Background information

Advice for buyer

Strategy

General GHG 
emissions 
calculations

An existing, published sustainability and/or environmental 
strategy can indicate to what degree the topic is part of the 
supplier’s overall business strategy and what importance the 
company places on the topic. It can also help to understand the 
actions the supplier is taking to address sustainability. Fuel- 
and energy-focused strategies can be considered as environ-
mental strategies as well.

The capability to report own GHG emissions footprint is essen-
tial to external stakeholders, especially clients, as they rely on 
this information for their footprint. It also indicates the degree 
of internal due diligence on the topic, as reporting is always the 
first step toward a more sustainable, low emission operation. 
An external auditing of the footprint provides validation, which can 
add significance and trust to the results.
GHGs refer to the sum of seven gases that have direct effects 
on climate change: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
The data is expressed in CO2 equivalents (CO2e) and refer to 
gross direct emissions from human activities.
•  Scope 1 emissions include the direct emissions from assets 
that are owned or controlled by your company. This includes 
the combustion of fuel purchased for use in your vehicles, 
vessels, aircrafts, locomotives, and generators, as well as 
buildings associated with logistics sites.

•  Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the produc-
tion and distribution of electricity purchased by your com-
pany for use in your logistics sites and electric vehicles.
•  Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from your supply 
chain. Transport emissions from your subcontractors and 
the Well To Tank (WTT) emissions from the fuels covered in 
Scope 1 are the important examples here. [2]

Targets

Published reduction targets reflect the sincerity of the supplier 
and add a level of accountability. Details on the progress the 
supplier has made in previous years may indicate the maturity 
of the progress.

The use of carbon offsetting indicates to what degree these 
targets include reducing actual emissions.

For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) a 
published strategy is not the norm and the buyer will 
need to consider if the lack of such a strategy is due to 
a lack of interest, or for other reasons.

LSPs and carriers, and SMEs in particular, do not tend 
to share their detailed GHG emissions footprint publicly. 
Greater importance should be placed on the fact that 
the footprint is measured and whether relevant details 
can be shared with you as a customer. External auditing 
can add costs for the supplier but gives external validation 
of the results and demonstrates the sincerity of the 
supplier. 

We do not recommend asking for details about the  
way these calculations are published as this depends 
on the supplier’s communication strategy and does  
not necessarily reflect on the quality or maturity of  
the results.

Depending on the supplier and their role in the supply 
chain, it is important to analyze which emission scope 
is subject to the targets. If targets are published using 
the Science Based Target initiative (SBTI) an external 
validation can be assumed. However, the implementation  
of SBTI is still limited in the logistics sector, so we 
refrain from specifically asking for them.

Absolute targets indicate the actual emission reduction, 
while relative targets reflect the emission intensity 
reduction. In general, absolute targets are desirable. 
For LSPs, relative targets may be more practical in the 
short term, as they are uncoupled from the overall, 
varying tonnage and indicate the effect of reduction 
measures in place.

Transport 
mode-specific 
emission 
calculations

The ability to disclose emission data, or at least the raw 
input data, is crucial as it enables the buyer to calculate their 
transport-related emissions. It also indicates the degree of 
internal groundwork in this area as reporting is always the first 
step toward a more sustainable, low emission operation.
Absolute and relative GHG emission reporting can be helpful  
in order to compare suppliers as well as different transport 
options and routings.
WTW (well-to-wheel) are emissions from the full fuel life  
cycle and should be equivalent to the sum of WTT and TTW 
emissions. WTT emissions consist of all processes between  
the source of the energy (the well) through the energy  
extraction, processing, storage and delivery phases up until  
the point of use (the tank). TTW are the emissions from fuels 
combusted to power Scope 1 activities (the wheel). TTW is 
considered to be zero for electricity, hydrogen fuel cells and 
biofuels - all emissions are in the WTT stages at the point of 
use. [2]

Sea Freight 
emissions 
calculations

Clean Cargo is the leading buyer-supplier forum for sustain-
ability in the cargo shipping industry.

Absolute GHG emissions at a business level are  
needed to calculate your own GHG emissions footprint. 
If companies are able to disclose their emissions in 
WTW CO2e, they will also be able to provide individual 
parts of it such as TTW CO2e or WTW CO2 if these are 
currently used in your organization. Tonne-kilometer 
(tkm) and fuel consumption should only be required 
when the carrier is not able to provide the emission 
data directly as fuel consumption especially is a  
sensitive item for carriers. Absolute and relative  
GHG emission reporting can be helpful in order to  
compare suppliers as well as different transport  
options and routings. SFC recommends using emission 
intensity as a KPI as it indicates the effectiveness  
of emission reduction measures independent of  
any fluctuation in absolute sales.
The term transport lane is used as a placeholder. 
Depending on the way your company segments its dif-
ferent businesses and wants to evaluate its transport 
routes, the appropriate wording and explanation should 
be added. Common industry terms are trade lane (sea 
freight), transport corridor or transport cluster (road 
freight), origin-destination or door-to-door (generic).
Detailed emission breakdowns on the basis of transport 
service categories (e.g. cargo type, contract type, journey 
type or condition (ambient/temperature-controlled)) as 
mentioned in the GLEC Framework can be explored 
at a later stage as they become more relevant to the 
reduction efforts.

TEU-kilometer (TEU-km) instead of mass or weight can 
also be used and later adjusted using a standardized 
conversion factor, which can be found in the GLEC 
Framework. A membership of Clean Cargo should  
be checked with carriers only but is beneficial, as  
a membership requires them to disclose detailed  
emission calculations. 

Airfreight 
emissions 
calculations

The Clean Air Transport is a buyer-supplier collaboration 
between shippers, freight forwarders, and air freight carriers to 
track and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from air freight and 
promote responsible freight transport.

Clean Air Transport’s membership should be considered 
as it grants privileged access to data provided by IATA, 
along with learnings for data usage and compliance 
with ISO standards for calculation.

Logistics sites 
emissions 
calculations

In order to assess GHG emissions for the entire supply chain, 
it is important to include GHG emissions from logistics sites. 
GHG emissions for logistics sites need to include all direct and 
indirect energy-related emissions.

This question is only applicable when logistics sites are 
an essential part of the tendered business. Facilities 
classed as logistics sites include terminals, ports,  
airports, warehouses, cross- docking sites and  
distribution centers, depending on their role in the 
transport chain. The emission intensity is expressed 
relative to tonnes. It is recommended to adjust this 
metric to the nature of the product. Asking for MWh 
(megawatt-hour) data is not recommended as  
operators might be reluctant to share them due to  
possible price scrutiny.
Moreover, it is important to note that currently a GHG 
emission breakdown at a customer level for mixed 
warehouses cannot be expected, so GHG emission 
intensity figures will be most likely based on total 
amount or averages for a specific warehouse or a
number of warehouses operated by the LSP/carrier. 
Therefore, normalized figures like the GHG emission 
intensity seem to be more meaningful.

Methodology 
& data source

Methodology examples are the GLEC Framework (global, all 
modes and logistics sites). The use of a specific methodology 
indicates a degree of validation and standardization in the way 
data are reported. The data source indicates how accurate the 
reported emission data actually are. Primary data mean that 
the actual consumption, mileage and tonnage have been con-
sidered by using e.g. fuel receipts, annual spend and odometers. 
Modeled data mean that as much actual data as possible and 
information such as goods type, consignment size, vehicle  
type is considered to model the emissions footprint through 
accredited tools. But the relevance of the result depends on the 
amount of available information and the model’s algorithms.  
If no other data are available, default data can be used. Default 
factors can be found, for example in the GLEC Framework or 
national legislations, and represent an industry average.  
However, if default data are the main source, the results can 
only give a general indication of emissions and cannot be used 
as a KPI as they are too generic.

If the data source is mostly primary data, it indicates 
that actual data are received from the subcontracted 
carrier if applicable. Therefore, this question is also 
a way to assess the engagement of your supplier 
with their subcontractors and the emission reporting 
requirements they have in place for them.

Initiatives

In order to drive real change, it is important that companies 
collaborate with other stakeholders in the industry. Membership 
in green freight programs and initiatives display a level of com-
mitment to the subject and can also indicate compliance with 
industry standards. 

The buyer can consider checking for specific programs 
during the RFI phase if a membership in these  
programs is mandatory due to the buyer’s own  
sustainability strategy.

Subcontracted 
carriers

Examples of decarbonization requirements can be agreements 
on mandatory measures like driver training or minimum vehi-
cle requirements that encourage the subcontracted carrier to 
operate in a more environmentally sustainable way.

Customers

The intent of this question is to assess the intention of the supplier 
to proactively engage with the buyer on a joint project. In order 
to make sure the supplier is sincere about this engagement, 
taking the initiative with such a project should be seen as the 
supplier’s responsibility. This question is not asking the supplier  
how they can help reduce the emissions for its buyer’s transport 
with their current methods, which is examined in the Innovation 
and Leadership part of the questionnaire.

Smart freight procurement can only be done effectively 
if all parties in the transport chain take responsibility 
and engage with their subcontractors. The expected 
level of collaboration should depend on the supplier’s 
size and market maturity. We refrain from asking 
specifically if GHG emission calculations are required 
from the subcontracted carriers as this can be assumed 
when a collaboration is in place. Question T.10.1 checks 
for the data source of the emission calculations, which 
indicates how emission data are provided to the supplier 
by its subcontracted carriers.

An assessment of pilot studies and projects that the 
carrier is doing in general can be beneficial, but if they 
cannot be used for your business, their implications 
are limited. This question will only be meaningful if 
your company is also able to participate in such a joint 
project.

Ratings reflect the confidence companies have in their  
environmental performance and display an external validation 
of it. This question focuses on voluntary reporting that is done 
in order to receive a rating through an international rating 
scheme and does not encompass the public reporting through 
annual reports or by other means.
International reporting and rating schemes include CDP,  
Ecovadis, Dow Jones Sustainability Index & others.

Certifications such as ISO 14083 in particular, and associated 
sustainability standards reflect external validation, a minimum 
standard and due diligence. If the Environmental management 
system is not yet certified, but a certification process is pending, 
please answer with Yes and provide more information in the 
next phase if requested.

In order to induce meaningful change, companies need to  
depart from ‘business-as-usual’ processes. Suppliers that  
can offer innovative fuel solutions including alternative or  
low emission fuels and structural solutions, such as emission 
optimized routing or modal shift, actively support the buyer in 
this change. While the general availability of these solutions 
would already be a positive differentiation, the actual impact  
for the buyer only comes to full effect when these solutions  
are also available for the tendered business.

In general, measures can focus on five areas: reducing the 
freight transport intensity, increasing vehicle utilization, increasing 
energy efficiency, reducing the carbon content of the used energy 
and promoting modal shift. Specific measures like routing 
optimization software, eco-driving training and low resistance 
tires are needed to effectively reduce emissions. The success of 
these measures is reflected in the actual emission data, but their 
existence is already a signal of the provider’s motivation and 
commitment.

The allocation of human resource, establishment of 
internal KPIs and the provision of staff training are a 
clear investment, but they also depend on the size and 
maturity of the supplier, which should be taken into 
account in the evaluation.

This question should be considered optional for SMEs.

Environmental management system certifications are so 
common in the industry that they might be meaningless 
as a differentiator depending on the audience.
For SMEs however, this can still be seen as a smart 
freight leadership differentiator. We do not ask for the 
pure existence of an environmental management system 
as only a certification is a meaningful confirmation of 
such a system.

Possible solutions should be provided only for major 
transport lane origin-destination pairs in an extensive 
tender. 

If the transport lanes in question are not specified in 
the RFI phase, we recommend asking for the general 
capability of offering different solutions.

However, this question should only be included if the 
tender requirements (mode of transport, transit time, 
deadlines) allow for flexibility in the solutions.

We refrain from providing a list or asking for specific 
measures, such as low resistance tires or eco-driving 
training, as we think these will be standard for carriers 
that are advancing on this topic and that their effect 
will be reflected in the emission intensity and target 
process. For smaller carriers, however, this could still 
be used as a differentiator and you should determine 
which measures are most meaningful to you. Depending 
on the market, you should declare certain measures, 
such as telematic software, as mandatory.
This question is therefore subject to market standards 
and maturity levels.

Road freight 
fleet

The average age and Euro emissions standard distribution of 
the providers own fleet are a straightforward way for a buyer 
to assess the general emission performance of a fleet and to 
benchmark fleets against one another.

Logistics site 
measures

In markets in which renewable energy is available, the switch 
to these energy sources for logistics sites is considered an 
easy and impactful measure. As a first step this can signal that 
a holistic approach is taken in the supplier’s freight-related 
emission reduction strategy.

This question should be asked to carriers primarily. 
LSPs have access to numerous subcontracted fleets 
and a buyer should determine minimum requirements 
when dealing with LSPs. However, for road carriers 
it is the most accessible information you can get and 
provides additional insights into the maintenance and 
fleet renewable programs. 

Depending on the market, we suggest also setting 
a maximum average fleet age and a minimum Euro 
emission standard that carriers must meet in order to 
be part of the tender process. 

This question can be asked as part of the the RFI process 
to assess the general market average in order to set 
realistic limits if market knowledge is not yet available. 
Please note that the Euro emission standards are a 
European system. Please adjust them to the country 
specific standards when used outside of the European 
market.

This question is only applicable when logistics sites are 
an essential part of the tendered business. Facilities 
classed as logistics sites include terminals, ports,  
airports, warehouses, cross- docking sites and  
distribution centers, depending on their role in the

logistics sites included in the tendered business, not  
for all of the supplier’s premises.

7.4 RFP Template 

Introduction

This document was designed by Sustainable Freight 
Buyer Alliance to support the procurement of sustain-
able logistics services during the RFP phase. This RFP 
template serves as a meaningful tool to companies 
seeking to evaluate the GHG performance of the 
transportation services offered by their suppliers.  
This document includes a link to the RFP template  
and provides guidance on its usage.

The aim is to provide clear instruction for companies 
interested in using this document to capture GHG 
emissions performance alongside the traditional 
commercial information for all types of logistics services, 
while providing the required flexibility required to 
support the input or outcome approach.

This document will provide specifics on the context,  
the structure and offers guidance on how to use the 
RFP template.

Context  

The RFP template has been designed to support the 
collection of GHG emissions performance of the 
different supplier’s offers during the tendering phare. 
Hence, this document should be used when launching 
an RFP or RFQ to gather potential solution offers from 
the selected suppliers. 

Structure 

The RFP template is composed of 3 sheets: 

•   The Bidding sheet: This sheer consolidates all the 

offer on the various lanes from the LSP, allowing for 
a consolidated view of the proposals.

•   Procurement: This sheet is the dedicated space for 
procurement to record their transportation needs 
lane by lane

•   LSP: It is the sheet where LSPs will be able to select 
the concerned lane and enter the details of their 
commercial offers. 

Instruction 

Bidding sheet: 
The bidding sheet is a consolidation of the different 
information entered by the procurement professional 
and LSP. This sheet will present the details of the 
shipment and its related commercial offers. While the 
bidding sheet provides the total emission generated by 
the shipment, the details of the emissions generated 
can be accessed by unhiding the columns between 
AA.and DZ.

Procurement: 
The procurement sheet is the space where the pro- 
curement professionals will be able to record all the 
transportation needs being tendered. By simply filling 
up the column from B to M with the details of the 
transport needs, it will allow the lanes details to be 
extracted and quoted by the LSP.

LSP: 
This sheet is where the LSP will be providing their 
commercial offer based on the shipment’s lanes.

The LSP should start first by populating the Lane  
ID of the Lane he wishes to quote for and click the  
import button.

Once the details have been extracted the lane details 
will be populated for review and confirmation. The  
LSP can then start populating the details of its  
commercial offer.

It is critical that the LSP as many fields as possible  
to provide the most accurate vision to the shipper,  
but 2 fields should always be populated:

•   “Number of legs” (column K) is a mandatory field as 
it will adapt the table to support up to 6 different 
legs in the shipments. Each of these legs (steps)  
will have its GHG emission calculated accordingly. 

•   “Are your GHG emission calculation audited or 

certified? “(column P) is mandatory field since the 
LSP ‘s answer will dictate if he can directly populate 
its GHG performance by filling up the columns:

•   CO2 intensity factors (column AA) should always 
be populated either with the audited value from

Should the GHG emission not be audited or should the 
LSP not able to provide these data, default data will be 
provided for the calculation to take place, based on the 
GLEC’s framework’s default values.

LSPs should ensure to fill up the following fields to 
ensure the calculation of the GHG emission on the 
shipment level:

the distance of each leg.

•   Payload (column H): The maximum total weight of 

the goods which can be transported by the equipment.

modes of transport to select from.

•   Type of equipment (column V): Provide the possible 
type of equipment to select from according to the 
modes of transport selected.

•   Type of energy/fuel (column W): Provide the different 
fuel or energy used by the equipment to select from.

•   Distance realized with the equipment (column AC): 
provide the total distance realized with the said 
equipment as a shipment might include multiple 
legs (different steps and equipment) and it is key to 
calculate the GHG emission to identify the distance 
realized for each equipment.

Once the different fields of the table have been completed, 
the LSP can add its offer by clicking the button “click 
here to add the offer into procurement v”.

Additionally, should the LSP add a second offer for the 
same lane ID, it is possible to do so by clicking the 
button “click here to reset this sheet and insert new 
offers. It is important to understand that this button  
will reset the previously populated table and so offers 
should be added into the bidding sheet first.

offsetting

EU ETS is a carbon emissions trading system implemented by the European Union to 
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from industries

Electric Vehicle

Greenhouse gases defined as those indicated by the latest IPCC Assessment Report

The total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly or indirectly by an individual,  
organization, or product

The process of compensating for greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that 
reduce or remove emissions elsewhere

GLEC

Global Logistics Emissions Council

Intermodal transport 

The use of multiple modes of transport (e.g. road, rail, sea) for a single shipment 

ISO

International Organization for Standardization 

ISO 14083:2023

This standard establishes a common methodology for the quantification and reporting of 
GHG emissions arising from the operation of transport chains of passengers or freight.

Last-mile delivery

The final stage of delivery typically from a transport hub to the end consumer

LCA

LSP

Modal shift

Primary data

Life Cycle Assessment 

Logistics Service Provider 

The transition from one mode of transport to another, such as from road to rail or sea 
transport 

Otherwise known as actual or measured data, it is the “quantified value of a process or 
an activity from a direct measurement or a calculation based on direct measurements.”

Tank-to-Wheel 
(TTW)

Tank-to-Wheel (or Tank-to-Wake for air and sea transport) refers to the section of the 
energy carrier’s life cycle where the energy carrier is converted to propulsion energy.

Tonne-kilometer

The unit of measure for freight transport, representing the transport of one tonne of goods 
over the distance of one kilometer.

Well-to-Tank (WTT)

The section of the energy carrier’s life cycle from the start of the initial process to  
generate the input feedstocks to the moment where it is supplied to the vehicle (at the 
recharging or refuelling station).

Well-to-Wheel 
(WTW)

Well-to-Wheel (or Well-to-Wake for air and sea transport) refers to the full energy carrier 
life cycle, i.e. the summation of the WTT and TTW phases.
