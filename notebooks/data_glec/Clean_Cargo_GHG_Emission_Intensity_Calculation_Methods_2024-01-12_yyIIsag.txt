INTRODUCTION 

This  document  outlines  the  methods  applied  in  calculating  Clean  Cargo  containership 
greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  intensities.  The  methods  described  here  are  based  on 
methods  originally  developed  by  the  members  and  secretariat  of  the  Business  for  Social 
Responsibility (BSR) Clean Cargo Working Group collaborative initiative. 

In 2022, the Clean Cargo secretariat transitioned from BSR to Smart Freight Centre (SFC). 
SFC established a Clean Cargo Methods Committee tasked with revising and maintaining the 
Clean Cargo GHG emission calculation methods. Clean Cargo member companies elect eight 
Clean Cargo Methods Committee members to represent them on the Clean Cargo Methods 
Committee  for  two-year  terms.  SFC  representatives  serve  as  the  permanent  chair  and  co-
chair of the Committee. The methods described here include changes to the previous (2015) 
version of the Clean Cargo methods. The changes were written based on Methods Committee 
deliberations in 2022. 

These  Clean  Cargo  methods  are  consistent  with  the  guidelines  described  in  the  Global 
Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework. For example, the Clean Cargo methods1: 

▪  Are based on emissions associated with the entire life cycle of an energy source (i.e., 

Well-to-Wake emissions). 

▪ 

Incorporate  the  warming  effect  from  all  GHGs  described  in  the  United  Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol (currently: carbon dioxide 
(CO2),  methane 
(HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons  (PFCs),  sulphur  hexafluoride  (SF6),  and  nitrogen  trifluoride  (NF3)). 
That is, Clean Cargo calculations are based on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions. 

(N2O),  hydrofluorocarbons 

(CH4),  nitrous  oxide 

For more on the GLEC Framework, see here. 

The methods described in this document: 

▪  Supersede all previous versions of the Clean Cargo methods. 
▪  Will  be  implemented  for  calculating  Clean  Cargo  GHG  emission  performance 

information beginning in 2024. 

For questions about these methods or about Clean Cargo in general, please contact SFC at

PART 1: CALCULATING CONTAINERSHIP GHG EMISSION PERFORMANCE 

Overview  

Clean Cargo GHG emission performance information reflects the GHG emissions intensity of 
Clean  Cargo  carriers’  vessels.  Emission  intensity  is  calculated  as  GHG  emissions  per 
transport activity, where transport activity is represented in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) 
kilometers (km). Units of measure for Clean Cargo emission intensities, then, are gCO2e per 
TEU-km. As noted above, the emission intensities are based on well-to-wake energy emission 
factors. 

Dry and Refrigerated Containers 

The Clean Cargo calculation methods distinguish between the emission intensity of standard 
dry container transportation and the emission intensity of refrigerated container transportation. 
This  distinction  allows  for 
the  increased  energy  consumption  associated  with  the 
transportation  of  temperature-controlled  cargo  to  be  reflected  in  the  Clean  Cargo  GHG 
emission intensities. 

Emission Intensity Formulas 

Clean Cargo dry and refrigerated container emission intensities are calculated based on the 
following formulas.

Where: 

▪  Fuel Emission Factor means the emission factor of the fuel consumed by the vessel. 

See Annex 1 for fuel emission factors applied in Clean Cargo calculations. 

▪  Total Fuel Consumption means the mass of all fuel consumed by the vessel (i.e., fuel 
consumed in main engines, auxiliary engines, and boilers) during the reporting period. 
Fuel Consumed includes fuel consumed in sea and at port. 

▪  Refrigerator Fuel Consumption is calculated as described below. 

▪  Distance  Sailed  means  the  total  distance  sailed  by  the  vessel  during  the  reporting 
period, in kilometers. Distance Sailed includes distance sailed at sea and in port. 

▪  Vessel  TEU  Capacity  means  the  maximum  number  of  TEU  a  vessel  can  carry,  as 
represented in the vessel capacity plan, general arrangement plan, or loading plan. 

▪  Vessel Refrigerated TEU Capacity means the number of refrigerated container plugs 
on the vessel multiplied by 1.9 (in many cases, a refrigerated plug services a container 
larger than a TEU). 

▪  0.7 represents an assumption that the vessel operates at 70% capacity utilization (i.e., 

the vessel carries 70% of its nominal container capacity, on every voyage)2.

of 70% across the largest historical Clean Cargo tradelanes.

PART 2: CARRIER DATA COLLECTION 

Carrier Data 

Clean Cargo carriers report the following data to SFC, by vessel name and IMO number, for 
each vessel in their operated or chartered fleet: 

▪  Amount of fuel consumed (for each type of fuel consumed) 

▪  Distance sailed 

▪  Number of days of operation 

▪  TEU capacity 

▪  Number of refrigerated container plugs 

This  data  is  applied  in  the  formulas  outlined  in  Part  1  to  calculate  vessel-specific  emission 
intensities for each vessel in each carrier’s fleet. 

Carriers  assign  a  tradelane  (or  tradelanes)  to  each  vessel  in  their  fleets.  Clean  Cargo 
tradelanes and trade regions are listed in Annex 2. Carriers must assign vessels to tradelanes 
as follows: 

1.  Determine the string on which the vessel was operating on the last day of that vessel’s 

operations for the carrier during a reporting period. 

2.  Determine which Clean Cargo trade regions in which the ports of call on that string are 

located. 

3.  If more than 75% of the vessel’s port calls on the string are in one region, assign the 

vessel to an intra-regional tradelane for that region. 

▪ 

If the vessel’s main service is on a global tradelane, assign the vessel to a global 
tradelane regardless of the percentage of port calls in a particular region. 

4.  If fewer than 75% of the vessel’s port calls on the string are in one region, assign the 

vessel to a global tradelane or tradelanes. 

▪ 

▪ 

Include all regions on the string in which 25% or more of the ports on the string are 
located. 

Include  the  regions  on  the  string  in  which  string’s  start  and  end  points  (i.e.,  the 
string’s “turnaround points”) are located. 

Tradelane assignments are applied in the formulas outlined in Part 4 to calculate tradelane 
level emission intensities for each carrier. 

Vessels Covered 

Carriers are required to report on vessels in their owned or chartered fleet but are not required 
to report on vessels that may carry cargo for the carrier under a vessel sharing agreement 
with another carrier. Similarly, carriers are not required to report on vessels that they do not 
own or operate but that they ship cargo on under a slot charter agreement. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting Period 

Carriers report the data described above twice per year: 

1.  In March, carrier reporting is completed for operations covering the previous calendar 
year  (e.g.,  a  carrier  will  complete reporting  on  2023 calendar  year  data in  March  of 
2024). 

2.  In September, carrier reporting is completed for operations covering the period from 1 
July  of  the  previous  year  through  30  June  of  the  current  year  (e.g.,  a  carrier  will 
complete reporting of July 2022 data through June 2023 data in September of 2023). 

Vessels that were operational for 90 or fewer days in a reporting period may be omitted from 
carrier reports. For example: 

▪  A  vessel  operational  for  less  than  90  days  during  the  2022  calendar  year  may  be 

omitted from the reporting completed in March 2023. 

▪  A vessel that was operational for fewer than 90 days between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 

2023 may be omitted from the reporting completed in September 2023. 

Data submitted in March serves as the foundation for SFC’s annual Global Ocean Container 
Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity reports. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PART 3: AGGREGATING DATA INTO PORT PAIR EMISSION INTENSITIES 

Port Pair Aggregation: General Calculation Methods 

As described in Part 2, Clean Cargo carrier data is collected at a vessel level. SFC partners 
with  its  data  reporting  platform  service  provider  to  aggregate  this  vessel  level  data  to  a 
weighted  average  carrier-specific  port  pair  emission  intensity.  Port  pair  aggregation  is 
conducted following three steps: 

1.  Calculate the transport activity (in TEU-km) each of the carrier’s vessels conducted on 
the port pair during the reporting period and use that transport activity to calculate the 
emissions each of the carrier’s vessels generated sailing on the port pair during the 
reporting period. 

2.  Calculate the total emissions of all the carrier’s vessels sailing on the port pair during 
the reporting period and the total transport activity conducted by the carrier’s vessels 
sailing on the port pair during the reporting period. 

3.  Divide the carrier’s total emissions from all vessels sailing on the port pair during the 
reporting period by the carrier’s total transport activity across all vessels sailing on the 
port pair during the reporting period. 

For example, a carrier has three vessels that sailed between ports A and B during the reporting 
period, Vessel 1, Vessel 2, and Vessel 3. The weighted average carrier-specific dry container 
emission intensity3 for the reporting period is calculated as follows:

3 The method shown here is also applied to calculate aggregated refrigerated container emissions for 
AB, by applying the vessel specific refrigerated container emission intensity (as described in Part 1) 
in the place of the vessel specific dry container emission intensity.

Variables in this example are determined as follows: 

▪  The  number  of  trips  AB  are  calculated  based  on  an  analysis  of  Automatic 

Identification System (AIS) data. 

▪  Distance sailed AB is calculated based on AIS data. 

▪  The vessel specific nominal capacity is reported by the carrier. 

▪  The vessel dry container emission intensity is calculated as described in Part 1. 

A carrier’s vessel is identified as sailing on the AB route during a reporting period based on 
AIS data. 

Transshipment: Introduction (not included in 2023 data reporting – to be implemented soon) 

When a carrier does not operate vessels that sail directly between a container’s port of origin 
and port of final destination but the carrier still offers a cargo transportation service between 
those  ports,  the  cargo  is  assumed  to  be  “transshipped.”  That  is,  the  cargo  is  transferred 
between vessels at intermediate ports on its voyage from the port of origin to the port of final 
destination. 

When a carrier does not operate vessels that sail directly between a container’s port of origin 
and  port  of  final  destination,  there  may  be  several  different  routes  that  cargo  could  take 
between those ports. For example, a carrier does not operate any vessels directly between 
ports A and E, but offers a transport service between ports A and E. The carrier can get cargo 
from port A to E by routing the cargo A-B-C-D-E, or A-F-E, or A-B-H-E, or A-G-D-E. 

In these transshipment situations, the route between the container’s port of origin and port of 
final destination is selected based on the Clean Cargo reporting platform service provider’s 
routing  identification system.  This routing identification system  selects the  most  likely  route 
between the container’s port of origin and port of final destination. For additional details on the 
approach applied in determining the “most likely” route, see Annex 4. 

Transshipment: Calculating Emission Intensities 

The  emission  intensity  for  container  transportation  on  the  route  selected  by  the  routing 
identification system is the weighted average of the emission intensity for a carrier’s transport 
on each leg of the selected route. 

For example, a carrier offers a transportation service between ports A and C. This carrier does 
not operate any vessels that sail directly between ports A and C. A shipper queries the Clean 
Cargo  reporting  platform  for  the  carrier’s  emission  intensity  for  container  transportation 
between A and C and the routing identification system determines that the most likely route 
between A and C is A-B-C. 

The  carrier’s  AB  and  BC  emission  intensities  are  calculated  individually  following  the 
three  steps  described  in  the  section  describing  general  calculation  methods  for  port  pair 
aggregation above. 

The carrier’s AC emission intensity is then calculated as follows: 

𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐴↔𝐶 =

(𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐴↔𝐵 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐴↔𝐵) + (𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐵↔𝐶 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐵↔𝐶)
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐴↔𝐵 + 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐵↔𝐶

This approach to calculating the emission intensity of transport between the container’s port 
of  origin  and  port  of  final  destination  means  that  the  emission  intensity  of  the  longer  legs 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between these ports have a greater influence on the route’s emission intensity than the shorter 
legs have on the route’s emission intensity. 

Transshipment: Carrier Does not Operate Vessels on all Legs of a Route 

A carrier may: 

▪  Offer a transportation service between a port of origin and port of final destination; and 

▪  Not operate vessels sailing directly between those ports; and 

▪  Not operate vessels sailing on all legs of the most likely route between those two ports. 

For the legs of the route between the port of origin and the port of final destination on which 
the  carrier  does  operate  vessels,  each  leg’s  emission  intensity  is  calculated  individually 
following the three steps described in the section describing general calculation methods for 
port pair aggregation above. 

For the legs of the route between the port of origin and the port of final destination on which 
the carrier does not operate vessels, the leg’s emission intensity is calculated based on the 
emission intensity for a vessel size range. 

For example: 

▪  Carrier 1 offers a transportation service between ports A and D. 

▪  Carrier 1 does not operate any vessels that sail directly between ports A and D. 

▪  The Clean Cargo reporting platform routing identification system determines that the 

most likely route between A and D is A-B-C-D. 

▪  Carrier 1 operates vessels on the legs AB and CD, but not on the leg BC. 

Carrier 1’s AB and CD emission intensities are calculated individually following the three 
steps described in the section describing general calculation methods for port pair aggregation 
above. The emission intensity for the leg BC is calculated as follows: 

1.  Determine the size range4 of the most common vessel sailing BC, across all Clean 

Cargo carriers that operate vessels sailing BC. 

2.  Determine  the  average  emission  intensity  in  Carrier  1’s  fleet  for  all  of  Carrier  1’s 

vessels in the size range determined at step one. 

3.  Assign the emission intensity determined at step two to the leg BC. 

4.  If Carrier 1 does not operate any vessels in the size range  determined at step one, 
determine the average global emission intensity out of all reporting carriers’ vessels in 
that size range. 

5.  Assign the emission intensity determined at step four to the leg BC. 

Carrier 1’s emission intensity for cargo shipped from A to D is then calculated as follows: 

𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐴↔𝐷

=

(𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐴↔𝐵 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐴↔𝐵) + (𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐵↔𝐶 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐵↔𝐶)(𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦𝐶↔𝐷 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶↔𝐷)
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐴↔𝐵 + 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐵↔𝐶 + 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶↔𝐷

4 There are ten container vessel size ranges used for this analysis. For more on the size ranges, see 
Annex 3. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                
PART 4: AGGREGATING DATA INTO TRADELANE EMISSION INTENSITIES 

As described in Part 2, Clean Cargo carrier data is collected at a vessel level. SFC partners 
with its data reporting platform service provider to aggregate this vessel level data to carrier 
specific  tradelane  emission  intensities.  Carrier-specific  tradelane  aggregation  is  conducted 
following three steps: 

1.  Calculate the total transport activity for each vessel in a carrier’s fleet that has been 
assigned  to  a  specific  tradelane  (see  Part  2  for  a  description  of  the  tradelane 
assignment process). 

2.  Calculate the total emissions generated by each vessel in a carrier’s fleet that has been 
assigned to that tradelane. These emissions are the product of the transport activity 
calculated at step one and the vessel’s global average emission intensity, calculated 
as  described  at  Part  1.  Calculate  the  emissions  separately  for  dry  and  refrigerated 
containers. 

3.  Divide  the  emissions  generated  by  all  vessels  in  the  carrier’s  fleet  assigned  to  the 
tradelane by the sum of the transport activity of all vessels in the carrier’s fleet assigned 
to  the  tradelane.  Calculate  the  emissions  separately  for  dry  and  refrigerated 
containers. 

For  example,  a  carrier  has  three  vessels  that  are  assigned  to  Tradelane  Z  for  a  reporting 
period (based on the tradelane assignment process described in Part 2), Vessel 1, Vessel 2, 
and Vessel 3.

PART 5: VERIFICATION OF CARRIER DATA 

Carriers must have the data they submit to SFC verified by a third party. Details on verification 
of data are described in the Clean Cargo verification guidelines. Verification is only required 
for  carrier  data  submitted  in  March  for  the  previous  calendar  year  (i.e.,  verification  is  not 
required for data submitted in September). Carriers must submit a verification statement along 
with data reported to SFC for the previous calendar year. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ANNEX 1: FUEL EMISSION FACTORS 

All emission factors used for Clean Cargo calculations are based on emission factors in the 
Global Logistics Emission Council Framework (2023).
