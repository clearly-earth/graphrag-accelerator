Use of SFC CAS trademarks 
Edition: 02 I  Date: 20-09-24  I  A Smart Freight Centre initiative 

1.  Introduction 

1.1. This document describes the procedures and conditions governing the use and protection of 
the Smart Freight Centre (SFC) Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS) trademarks, or any 
reference to SFC Approval by an approved Validation and Verification Body (VVB) or to SFC 
Listing by an Emissions Reporter (ER). 

1.2. This procedure becomes effective on the date of issue indicated above. 

2.  Scope and applicability 

2.1. This document applies to VVBs and individual verifiers who have been approved by SFC, and 
to ERs which have been verified by VVBs approved by SFC. No other entities may use SFC 
CAS trademarks.  

2.2. “SFC  CAS  trademark  (or  mark)”  means  a  legally  registered  trademark  applied  under  the 
procedures of the SFC CAS, licensed by SFC to be used by VVBs and individual verifiers who 
are  approved  by  SFC,  and  to  ERs  who  have  been  verified  by  VVBs  approved  by  SFC,  to 
indicate their direct conformity with a set of requirements. 

2.3. “Approval  Scope”  applies  to  VVBs  or  individual  verifiers  and  means  specific  conformity 
assessment services for which Approval is sought or has been granted. There are currently 
two  Approval  Scopes  in  the  SFC  CAS:  ISO  14083  and  MBM  Specification.  The  approval 
scopes  and  process  are  detailed  in  the  manuals  ASU-PRO-002-2  and  ASU-PRO-008-2 
respectively. 

2.4. “Listing Scope” applies to ERs which have been verified by VVBs approved by SFC and means 
specific  GHG  reporting  types  for  which  Listing  is  sought  or  has  been  granted.  There  are 
currently two Listing Scopes in the SFC CAS: ISO 14083 and MBM Specification. The Listing 
scopes  and  process  are  detailed  in  the  manuals  ASU-PRO-001-2  and  ASU-PRO-007-2 
respectively. 

2.5. The  SFC  CAS  trademarks  that  are  available  for  these  third  parties  to  use  consist  of  the 
“stamps” shown in figure 1 below. These stamps may only be used in the form, size and colors 
as detailed in this document.

3.  General requirements 

Edition 02 

20.09.24  

3.1. SFC is the owner of all rights worldwide in and to the SFC CAS trademarks, and is responsible 
for their protection. No other entity has the right to apply to register, register, or claim rights in 
any mark containing or consisting of the SFC CAS mark or any confusingly similar marks. 

3.2. The  SFC  CAS  includes  the  approval  of  VVBs  by  SFC.  As  part  of  the  agreement  that  is 
established  with  each  approved  VVB,  SFC  grants  them  a  royalty-free,  revocable,  non-
exclusive and non-transferable license to use the SFC trademarks on promotional material, in 
annual  and  other  reports,  and/or  display  on  verification  reports  and  statements/  opinions 
issued  in  connection with  the  SFC  CAS.  Specifically,  SFC  grants  them  the  right  to  use  the 
“Approved VVB” stamp. The “Approved VVB” stamp is used by VVBs to identify their approved 
status. It is a tool for VVBs to demonstrate that their verification services meet the standards 
defined in the SFC CAS (see details in section 4 below). 

3.3. The VVB shall indicate under the SFC stamp the short name of the CAS. This information is 
to be centered under the stamp. The wording must appear in English, as follows: “Approved 
VVB for the SFC CAS: ISO to provide validation & verification” or “Approved VVB for the SFC 
CAS:  ISO+MBM  to  provide  validation  &  verification”,  depending  on  whether  the  VVB  is 
Approved  for  only  one  or  both  scopes.  The  name  of  the  CAS  as  indicated  above  must  be 
clearly indicated when using the stamp or when making reference to SFC approval (see details 
in the next section). 

3.4. The SFC CAS also includes the approval of individual verifiers by SFC. SFC grants individual 

verifiers the right to use the “Approved Verifier” stamp.  

3.5. The following wording must appear under the “Approved Verifier” stamp: “Approved verifier for 
the SFC CAS: ISO” or “Approved verifier for the SFC CAS: ISO+MBM”, depending on whether 
the verifier has been approved for only one or both scopes. 

3.6. Finally,  ERs  who  request  verification  services  against  SFC  scope  ISO  14083  from  VVBs 
approved by SFC are granted a license to use one of the “Level X” stamps, specifically the 
one that corresponds to the level that was confirmed by their SFC approved VVB. 

3.7. The following wording must appear under the "Level X” stamp: “Verified as level X by a VVB 

approved by SFC”.   

3.8. ERs  who  request  verification  services  against  SFC  scope  MBM  Specification  from  VVBs 
approved by SFC are granted a license to use the MBM stamp (the one shown in figure 1, 
bottom right). 

3.9. The  following  wording  must  appear  under  the  MBM  stamp:  “Verified  as  complying  with  the 

MBM Specification by a VVB approved by SFC”.

3.10.  The ER stamps mentioned in clauses 3.6 through 3.9  can also be used by the VVB that 
carries out the verification service for the ER in question, on the verification statement/ opinion 
issued to that client. 

3.11.  The conditions for the use of this license are contained in the agreements with these three 

types of entities (ERs, VVBs and individual verifiers).

reputational  damage  to  SFC,  or  confusion  regarding  SFC’s  role  or  affiliation  with  another 
organization or activity. 

3.13.  SFC  reserves  the  right  to  request  removal  of  its  licensed  material  from  any  publication, 

material or website.

4.3. The stamps must only appear on a white background, be clear and legible. 

4.4. A  clear  space  must  be  maintained  around  the  stamp  to  ensure  clarity  in  busy  visual 
environments. For easy reference, this is equivalent to the height of the ‘F’ in Freight. No other 
graphic elements may appear in this area (see figure 3 below).
