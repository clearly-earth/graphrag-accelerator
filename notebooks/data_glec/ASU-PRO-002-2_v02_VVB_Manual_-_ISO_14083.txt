Validation and Verification Body Manual – ISO 14083 

Edition: 02  I  Date: 30-09-24  I  A Smart Freight Centre initiative 

1.  Introduction 

1.1.  The  Smart  Freight  Centre  Conformity  Assurance  Scheme  (SFC  CAS)  for  'Validation  and 
Verification  of  GHG  emissions  statements  for  transport  chains'  provides  a  global  scheme  for 
independent  verification  of  GHG  emissions.  It  is  based  on  the  requirements  set  out  in  ISO 
standards as well as others that are specific to the SFC scheme as outlined in Section 4. It also 
provides optional performance levels for organizations to apply for, as they move forward along 
their decarbonization journey – criteria for these performance levels are also subject to verification, 
if the reporter wants to apply them.   

1.2. The SFC CAS defines two technical scopes:  

1.2.1. ISO 14083 Scope: covered in this document.  

1.2.2.  MBM  Specification  Scope:  covered  in  the  Validation  and  Verification  Body 
Manual – MBM Specification (SFC-PRO-008-2).  

1.3. The Validation and Verification Body Manual  – ISO 14083 (this document) provides the 
specific criteria and procedures under which a Validation and Verification Body (VVB) becomes 
approved (and maintains approval) for the ISO 14083 Scope. It also covers procedures that must 
be followed by VVBs when providing verification services, as well as for qualification of individual 
verifiers.   

1.4. This procedure becomes effective on the date of issue indicated above. 

2.  Scope and applicability 

2.1. This document is applicable to all VVBs seeking to conduct verifications as part of the SFC 
CAS for the ISO 14083 Scope. Specifically, this document contains:   

2.1.1. Procedures for a VVB to apply for (and maintain) approval as an SFC VVB  for the 
ISO 14083 Scope,   
2.1.2.  Procedures  for  individuals  to  be  approved  as  SFC-qualified  verification  personnel, 
and maintain their SFC approval for the ISO 14083 Scope,  
2.1.3. Procedures for a VVB to carry out verification activities.  

2.2. Participation in the SFC CAS is voluntary and based on objective criteria. The scheme is not 
discriminatory to ERs or VVBs.

3.  Documents 

3.1.  The  rules  and  requirements  for  the  SFC  CAS  are  set  out  in  the  program  documents. 
Complementing  this document  are  other SFC  procedures,  templates  and  forms,  and  standards 
issued by external entities or SFC. SFC may issue new documents, and the complete and current 
list of the program documents is available on the SFC website.  

3.2. SFC assurance documents are labeled with a version number and specify their effective date. 
Where  documents  that  are  relevant  for  the  SFC  CAS  are  updated,  the  updates  made  will  be 
summarized in an appendix. If applicable, a transition period will be specified. VVBs approved by 
SFC and ERs registered with SFC will be informed of the updates.  

3.3. Where documents are referenced, and such documents are updated, the most recent version 
of the document shall be used, and their transition period considered.  

3.4. The following are normative documents (i.e., standards) for the ISO 14083 Scope:  

A. 

Reporting standards: 

3.4.1.  ISO  14064-1,  Greenhouse  gases  –  Part  1:  Specification  with  guidance  at  the 
organization  level  for  quantification  and  reporting  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and

Definitions: 

3.7. Definitions as set out in ISO 17000 and the ISO standards referenced above apply to the SFC 
CAS.  

4. 

Scope of Approval and Fees 

4.1. The type of claims to be subject to verification are GHG emissions for an individual specified 
transport chain operation (i.e., reported historic data). The criteria against which the claim is to be 
assessed are listed in section 3B. 

4.2. SFC has defined three performance levels within which verified emissions reports may lie and 
for  which  Emissions  Reporter’s  may  apply;  if  the  Emissions  Reporter  intends  to  apply  for  SFC 
recognition under a specific performance level, the associated criteria specified for that level will 
be included within the verification criteria; performance level criteria are set out in the Emissions 
Reporter Manual (ASU-PRO-001-2). Approval of VVBs is given for all performance levels, for a 
worldwide scope for a set period. 

4.3.  SFC  charges  fees  to  cover  administration  costs,  at  the  rates  set  out  in  the  document 
Assurance Fees for VVBs (ASU-FEE-001-2).   

5.  Approval of VVBs 
5.1.  Approval Process 

5.1.1.  Approval  will  only  be  granted  to  a  legal  entity  registered  under  applicable  national  laws, 
irrespective of whether the entire organization or a part of it performs verification services.  

5.1.2. Verification bodies are eligible  to provide verification services under the SFC CAS – ISO 
14083 Scope if they are accredited under ISO 17029 for application of ISO 14065 for verification 
of  GHG  statements  for  the  transport  sector,  by  an  accreditation  body  that  is  a  signatory  of  the 
International Accreditation Forum Multilateral Agreement for GHG Verification. 

5.1.3. An approved VVB shall maintain their ISO accreditation. Failure to maintain accreditation, 
or lapse of accreditation, may result in the immediate suspension and revocation of SFC approval. 
If a VVB loses, changes or does not renew its accreditation during the three-year period from the 
date of approval, it shall immediately notify SFC. 

5.1.4. To apply to become an approved VVB with the SFC CAS, organizations must complete the 
VVB  application  form  (ASU-TPL-002-2)  and  submit  the  signed  application,  along  with  all 
supporting

5.1.5. Applicants must sign the License Agreement SFC-VVB (ASU-TPL-008-2). Applicants must 
also pay the application fee defined in the fee schedule. The application shall only be considered 
when SFC has received all the documentation  

Edition 02 

30.09.24  

5.1.6. The objective of a VBB approval assessment is to determine whether the VVB complies with 
additional  SFC  requirements  regarding  eligibility,  competence  and  operational  capability  to 
perform verification services for the SFC CAS. 

5.1.7. All documentation provided by a VVB as part of their application shall be in English. The 
language used in approval assessments is English. 

5.1.8. All decisions regarding the approval, suspension, or revocation of VVBs approval status are 
made at the sole discretion of SFC, upon recommendation of the Assurance Manager and decision 
of a senior person that is a member of the SFC Assurance Committee. 

5.1.9. The approval of VVBs by SFC is provided on a recurring basis. The approval is valid  for 
three years from the date of the approval decision. For re-approval the VVB shall re-submit the full 
set of information, updated as required, and no later than eight weeks prior to the end of the three-
year period.  

5.1.10. If the documentation is found to be incomplete, SFC shall inform the VVB of the missing 
elements  within  15  calendar  days  of  the  application  being  submitted.  If  the  documentation  is 
complete, SFC shall acknowledge this to the VVB, and finalize an Assessment report (ASU-TPL-
007-2) within four weeks of having acknowledged the application. 

5.1.11. Based on the report findings, SFC shall decide whether to approve or reject the VVB and 
inform the VVB accordingly.  

5.1.12. VVBs can apply without having approved verifiers, but the application cannot be approved 
until they have two approved personnel as detailed in section 6. Until this happens, SFC can issue 
an “in principle approval”, which documents that this is the only element that is missing. 

5.1.13.  Where  an  application  is  rejected,  SFC  shall  provide  the  applicant  with  a  justification. 
Reapplication  by  the  VVB  may  be  submitted  no  sooner  than  six  months  after  the  date  of 
communication of rejection by SFC and shall include details of how issues identified by SFC have 
been addressed. 

5.1.14. A list of VVBs approved to undertake verification services under the SFC CAS is available 
on the SFC website, containing information on:   

5.1.14.1. Contact details,  
5.1.14.2. List of approved auditors,  
5.1.14.3. Approval date and status (approved, suspended or revoked), 
5.1.14.4. A link to the accreditation body certificate for its ISO 17029/ 14065 accreditation 
certificate. 

5.2.  Suspension or revocation of VVB status

5.2.1. If SFC receives complaints about VVBs it has approved from Emission Reporters or other 
stakeholders, it shall investigate the allegations made. If as a result of this investigation SFC finds 
evidence  that  a  VVB  intentionally  provided  false  information,  intentionally  omitted  to  provide 
required information, deliberately violated any approval requirement, or performs poorly on regular 
basis.  SFC shall promptly submit a draft assessment report to the VVB documenting its findings. 
On the basis of this report, SFC may suspend or revoke the VVB’s approved status; this shall be 
reflected in its updated status on the VVB database accessible on the SFC website.  

Edition 02 

30.09.24  

5.2.2. The VVB shall be offered an opportunity to present clarification or further evidence before 
its approval is suspended or revoked, and may later appeal such decisions. 

5.2.3. Within 30 calendar days of suspension or revocation of SFC approval, the VVB shall remove 
all  SFC  assurance marks  from  its  website  and  communication materials.  VVBs  that have  been 
suspended or revoked shall not carry out verification services associated with the SFC CAS, and 
shall not use SFC assurance marks for any purpose. 

5.2.4.  An  approved  VVB  may  voluntarily  request  to  withdraw  its  approval  status  by  providing  a 
written notice to SFC requesting such withdrawal. 

5.3.  Notification of changes and SFC rights 

5.3.1. A VVB shall notify SFC at least 30 calendar days before implementing a planned change in 
its legal, commercial, or organizational status. It shall also inform SFC of significant changes to 
organizational structure and top management, and of personnel directly involved in the SFC CAS. 

5.3.2.  One  of  SFC’s  roles  is to oversee  VVBs  operating  under  the  scheme, both  for  their  initial 
approval  and  ongoing  performance.  Where  SFC  identifies  serious  shortcomings  in  a  VVB’s 
performance that are relevant for accreditation, it may provide feedback and require the VVB to 
address these issues.    

5.3.3. SFC reserves the right not to list approved VVBs or register clients of VVBs where it deems 
that  they  do not  conform  with  the  scheme  rules.  SFC  reserves  the  right  to  delist  VVBs or  their 
clients where it deems that they have not been verified in accordance with the scheme rules.  

5.3.4. SFC also reserves the right to take action against VVBs in accordance with the provisions 
set out in the agreements signed between individual VVBs and SFC. The rights and obligations for 
VVBs are set out in these agreements.

services that the personnel have provided that could be relevant for verification activities in which 
they are involved. 

Verification Process 
7. 
7.1.  Planning the verification 

7.1.1. VVBs shall conform to the requirements of ISO 17029, ISO 14065 and ISO 1464-3. Set out 
below are additional requirements needed for the SFC CAS, or clarifications are to how an element 
of these standards are to be applied for the SFC CAS. 

7.1.2. Before commencing a verification engagement, the VVB  will establish the objectives and 
identify  the  type  of  GHG  claim  to  be  verified:  for  the  SFC  CAS,  claims  are  reportable  GHG 
emissions (i.e., reported historic data). 

7.1.3. Criteria are the set of requirements against which the emissions report is verified: for the 
SFC CAS these are the relevant requirements of ISO 14083 and ISO 14064-1 as documented in 
the Emissions Reporter’s Monitoring Plan1. 

7.1.4.  The  level  of  assurance  shall  be  established  in  discussion  with  the  Emissions  Reporter, 
considering the SFC Performance Level being sought - see Emissions Reporter Manual – ISO 
14083  (ASU-PRO-001-2)  for  details.  The  justification  for  the  level  of  assurance  shall  be 
documented by the VVB in the Verification Opinion. 

7.2.  Uncertainty and materiality 

7.2.1. SFC recognizes that there is uncertainty inherent in the use of calculation tools, estimates, 
models,  defaults  factors  etc.  The  Monitoring  Plan  must  include  a  clear  description  of  any  such 
estimate approaches applied.  

1   Both ISO14064-1 and ISO14083 are context specific so not all elements will apply to an individual Emissions 
Reporter, therefore the Reporter is required to compile a Monitoring Plan that details the elements that are applied in 
their context.  Verifiers will check both the content of the Monitoring Plan against the ISO requirements; AND the 
implementation of the Monitoring Plan to conform that emissions calculations are conformant with all three 
documents.

Validation and Verification Body Manual – ISO 14083 
[Title] 

7.2.2. If a calculation tool or model is ‘SFC approved’ then no further checking is required of it on 
the part of the verifier, given that the verifier can presume that – provided the input data is valid – 
a  correct  output  will  be  returned  and  inherent  uncertainty  is  acceptable.   If  a  calculation  tool or 
model is NOT ‘SFC approved’ then the verifier will need to satisfy themselves that it returns valid 
results. This may include requesting a validation report from the supplier of the model and/or other 
information on how the model has been developed and submitted to independent validation.

7.2.3.  For  a  default  factor,  SFC  recognizes  those  mentioned  within  the  latest  versions  of  ISO 
14083, or from another authoritative source such as published by the United Nations, governments 
or GHG Protocol. Inherent uncertainty associated with recognized defaults is accepted. 

7.2.4. ISO14064-3 defines materiality as: the concept that individual misstatements or aggregation 
of misstatements in data reported could influence the intended user’s decisions.  Misstatements 
are defined as: errors, omissions, misreporting or misrepresentations.  

7.2.5. Materiality is used both for planning verification activities and their focus, and in formulating 
the  final  conclusion.  Materiality  has  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects:  when  assessing 
qualitative  materiality,  VVBs  must  determine  whether  the  report  conforms  to  rules  and 
methodology  requirements.  When  assessing  quantitative  materiality,  VVBs  must  assess  the 
impact of errors etc. on the total sum of GHG emissions stated in the Emissions Report.  

7.2.6.  Materiality  threshold  is  the  ‘defined  threshold’  above  which  a  verifier  will  not  accept 
aggregate misstatements in the reported emissions.  This means - within the defined scope of the 
emissions report, and ignoring acceptable ‘uncertainty’ as defined above - misstatements including 
errors in data/ values used in calculations, formula errors, missing data, calculation errors etc. The 
‘defined  threshold’  is  a  %  of  the  total  aggregate  emissions  agreed  between  the  VVB  and  the 
Emissions  Reporter  and  stated  in  the  final  verification  report.  A materiality  threshold  of  5%  (for 
example) means aggregate errors exceeding ±5% of the total sum are deemed material and would 
result in a ‘not verified’ opinion statement.  Uncertainties inherent in the methodology itself are not 
to be considered. 

7.2.7. The materiality shall be established in discussion with the Emissions Reporter, considering 
the SFC Performance Level being sought - see Emissions Reporter Manual (ASU-PRO-001-2) 
for details. The justification for the materiality shall be documented by the VVB in the Verification 
Opinion. 

7.3.  Carrying out the verification 

7.3.1.  Once  a  contractual  agreement  has  been  reached,  and  a  competent  verification  team 
selected, the VVB is required to follow the steps included in section 6 of 14064-3 to carry out the 
verification itself. Subsequently the VVB shall follow sections 8, 9 and 10 of 14064-3.  

7.3.2. In the first year of the first verification cycle, the VVB shall visit the main location(s) where 
emissions calculations are conducted and where records are stored. Over time (if the organization 
is reporting annually) circumstances may justify verifications can be conducted remotely because 
none of the relevant criteria mentioned in ISO 14064-3 are met.

7.3.3.  Verification  of  the  reported  GHG  emissions  shall  focus  on  the  appropriate  selection  of 
Transport Chain Operation (TCO), Transport Chain Element (TCE), Transport Operation Category 
(TOC)/  Hub  Operation  Category  (HOC),  correct  use  of  input  data  sources  and  the  correct 
calculation of emissions including plausibility checks of inputs values.

7.3.4. Regarding the responsibility for acceptance of inputs taken into account as part of verification 
activities,  conformity  assessment  results  which  are  generated  prior  to  the  engagement  or  are 
provided by the client can be accepted by the VVB with no further verification needed, provided 
they have been verified in a manner consistent with SFC requirements and a verification report 
provides the adequate level of detail about the basis of the opinion.  

7.3.5.  The  verifier  shall  prepare  a  verification  report  containing  its  opinion.  The  report  shall 
document, among other things, any outstanding misstatements, either material or not.  

7.3.6. The VVB shall establish procedures which it considers necessary to obtain sufficient and 
appropriate  evidence  for  its  verification  conclusion  (both  for  limited  and  reasonable  assurance 
levels). The procedures shall follow section 6.1.3 of 14064-3. 

7.3.7. The following activities are expected in planning and carrying out verification activities:  

7.3.7.1. Understand the scope and boundary (organizational and operational) of the claims made.  

7.3.7.2.  Review  the  organization’s  GHG  reporting  guidance  and  Monitoring  Plan,  including  the 
methodology for calculating GHG emissions. 

7.3.7.3. Understand the organization’s procedures for: 

7.3.7.3.1. data measurement and collection (relating to TCEs and TOCs),  

7.3.7.3.2. data measurement and collection (relating to fuel and transport activity),  

7.3.7.3.3. determining data sources, and related systems and internal control procedures. 

7.3.7.4. Review the: 

7.3.7.4.1. emissions sources identified by the organization and assess completeness,  

7.3.7.4.2. sources of emissions factors and Global Warming Potentials used in calculating 
its GHG emissions,  

7.3.7.4.3. Quality control procedures carried out by the organization on the data collected, 

7.3.7.4.4. Review the calculations and assertions relating to the data type (own fleet, carrier 
direct,  carrier  data  from  programs,  models  /  tools,  default  factors)  claimed  by  the 
organization,  

7.3.7.4.5. Review the organization’s declaration of total logistics GHG emissions (Scope 1, 
2 and 3) and carry out tests of detail to confirm the accuracy of the calculated emissions,   

7.3.7.4.6. Review the organization’s emissions intensity data and carry out tests of detail to 
confirm the accuracy of the calculated emissions.
