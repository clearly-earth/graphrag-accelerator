Assurance Fees for VVBs 
Edition: 02  I  Date: 20-09-24  I  A Smart Freight Centre initiative 

1.  Scope and Purpose 

1.1. This document outlines the SFC fee schedule for its Conformity Assessment Scheme (CAS), 
as it applies to Validation and Verification Bodies (VVBs). Fees defined for VVBs as part of the 
SFC CAS are called Approval Fees. 

1.2. This procedure becomes effective on the date of issue indicated above. 

2.  Fees 

2.1. The  VVB  fee  covers  all  services  needed  to  ensure  the  necessary  oversight  of  the  CAS, 
specifically for VVBs. The VVB fee is calculated based on the CAS scope for which the VVB 
has applied to SFC for approval.  

2.2. Application Approval Fee: The non-refundable application fee for a VVB is €3 000. It must 
be paid in advance by an applicant VVB before SFC commences any approval activities. The 
fee  covers  review  of  the  VVB  application  and  supporting  documentation,  reporting  and 
decision-making, and management of VVB listing and of SFC CAS marks. It also includes a 
contribution towards the costs of managing potential misuse of approval, investigation of third-
party  complaints,  maintenance  of  SFC  competence  and  update  of  its  training  provision 
services for VVBs. 

2.3. Annual Approval Fee: The SFC Annual Fee for ongoing maintenance of Approval is €2 000. 
The fee is invoiced in January and payable in full within 30 days. The Annual Fee will not be 
invoiced to applicants within the first calendar year of application. This Fee covers the renewal 
of  the  approval  of  VVBs  before  their  approval  certificate  expires  at  the  end  of  the  3-year 
approval cycle. In years that are not a renewal year, it covers the review of a random sample 
of VVB outputs, such as Verification Opinions. 

2.4. Training Fees: The SFC CAS requires mandatory training for verifiers, as described in the 
VVB  Manuals  (ASU-PRO-002-02  and  ASU-PRO-008-02).  The  cost  of  such  training  will be 
defined and communicated on a case-by-case basis, and is defined per person. However, for 
planning purposes it is estimated as the following for each scope: one day initial remote training 
at €1800 + €200 for taking the associated exam; one annual half day remote ongoing training 
session at €600 per session.

2.5. Daily Rate: The SFC Assurance daily rate is €1 000. 

2.6. Approval for more than one scope: VVBs can apply for more than one scope of the SFC 
CAS. The scopes are described in the VVB Manuals (ASU-PRO-002-02 and ASU-PRO-008-
02). The fees described above apply to each individual scope, in their full value. Approval for 
the ISO 14083 Scope is a pre-requirement for approval for the MBM Specification Scope. 

3.  Conditions 

3.1. Normally, the investigation of third-party complaints is covered by the Annual Approval Fee. 
However in some cases the need for more in-depth investigation may require significant time. 
For these in-depth complaint investigations and other ad hoc exceptional work, SFC reserves 
the right to charge extra assurance fees. These will be budgeted at the SFC Assurance daily 
rate. SFC shall inform the VVB in advance of these activities with a quote for the estimated fee 
for  them.  For  further  information  regarding  complaints,  see  the  SFC  Disputes  Procedure 
(ASU-PRO-005-02). 

3.2. The  SFC  Fee  Schedule  shall  be  revised  and  adjusted  annually,  in  line  with  inflation  and 

possible changes to the activities it covers. 

3.3. Fees outlined in the SFC Fee Schedule do not include Value Added Tax (VAT) or any other 

duties or taxes. Payment of any invoice is due within 30 days of the issue date.
