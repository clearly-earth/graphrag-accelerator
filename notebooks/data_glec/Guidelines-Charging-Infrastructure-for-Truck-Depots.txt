1. Introduction 

1.1. Reasons to go electric 

All European countries, citizens, and businesses share a common mission to strive for sustainability. 
As part of this mission, all modes of transport, including commercial freight vehicles, must undergo 
electrification in order to reach national and European carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets.  

According to the European commission, heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) contribute to more than a quarter 
of CO2 emissions from road transport1, although only representing 2.5 % of the road fleet2. This means 
that the over  6.4 million medium and heavy commercial vehicles on EU roads  play a major role  in 
achieving sustainability. To promote truck electrification, the European Union (EU) will continuously 
strengthen legislation and requirements for vehicle emissions.  

As  such,  in  2023,  the  European  commission  has  proposed  to  strengthen  the  regulation  on 
CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.3 The new regulation would aim at a 45% reduction 
in heavy-duty vehicle emissions (compared to 2019 levels) in 2030, and a 90% reduction in 2040. This 
means  that  converting  to  electric  trucks  ultimately  will  be  a  requirement  and  a  prerequisite  to 
participate and compete in the market. 

Electrification, however, should not only be seen as a duty and a requirement. It is also an opportunity 
for truck owners and depot operators to proactively prepare for the transition to achieve economic 
benefits  and  a  competitive  edge.  Despite  the  initial  investment  costs  on  vehicles  and  charging 
infrastructure,  electric  transportation  holds  long-term  total  cost  of  ownership  (TCO)  benefits, 
including  lower  maintenance  costs  for  vehicles  and  lower  fuel  costs  (current  energy  prices 
notwithstanding). 

TNO - Traffic & Transport has found that, by 2026, 90% of all truck segments investigated will reach a 
lower TCO, assuming an increasing parity in truck acquisition costs4. This will happen faster for low or 
medium milage trucks compared to long-haul trucks, due to the lower investment cost of the lighter 
truck segments. For a truck in a specific segment, however, the overall TCO will improve compared to 
a fossil-driven alternative, the more that it is driven.  

1.2. The importance of charging infrastructure 

A sufficient and effective charging infrastructure is the foundation for electrifying transportation. This 
is  also  clearly  visible  though  the  large  emphasis  the  European  commission  has  put  on  charging 
infrastructure as a prerequisite to achieve electrification targets.

1. Introduction 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) sets targets for the available charging power 
and spatial distribution of charging infrastructure for light and heavy-duty EVs5. 

Along the the Trans-European Network (TEN-T), charging options for heavy-duty vehicles should be 
no more than 60 km apart by 2025 and with power values of 1.4 MW by the end of 2030 and 3.5 MW 
by 2035, with at least one 350 kW station being required for each location.  

Though this will help long-haul transport, the vast majority of HDV charging will happen at depots – 
making  this  the  single  most  important  infrastructure.  According  to  the  European  EV  Charging 
Infrastructure Masterplan6 for a 30% reduction scenario in 2030, around 84% of the 279,000 charging 
outlets needed for electrical trucks will be located at fleet hubs (opposed to “Public fast – highway” 
and “Public overnight”). In terms of energy, fleet hubs are expected to cover 53% of the total energy 
demand for electric trucks. For urban/regional trucks, addressed by this guide, the dependence on 
charging hubs (including private depots) will be even greater. 

It is therefore important for fleet and depot owners to proactively prepare this depot infrastructure. 
A risk however is that initial costs and technical uncertainties will hold back this development. This 
guide is made to help getting started on electrifying truck depots. 

1.3. How this guide can help 

This guide will provide information and guidance to companies owning and operating private truck 
depots and aims at supporting better and more informed decisions on investing in charging solutions. 

The guide is specifically aimed at private depots established to serve a single fleet of trucks for hour-
long inter-shift layovers in the daytime or during night – and not charging hubs or logistics centers 
established to provide B2B charging, logistics and parking services. 

The depots aimed at by this guide would service as base for trucks of a single company serving an 
urban or regional area.  

Based on the above, we assume that the company owning the fleet and the depot to be the same, 
although this may not always be the case. While it may complicate the investment strategy and costs 
if the depot owner and fleet owner are different, we still believe the guide can provide help in such 
situations. 

The guide is organized as follows: 

First, we provide a brief overview of charging solutions for trucks in order to provide the reader with 
basic knowledge and terminology on the topic. 

Next, we list the most important questions which the depot operator should start considering, all of 
which determine the type of charging infrastructure needed. This list is useful when communicating 
with possible providers of charging infrastructure and services. 

The  guide  then  describes  the  high-level  phases  of  charging  infrastructure  procurement  including 
timelines and CapEx. While most of the numbers are based on the authors’ experience from Denmark,

they  are  complemented  with  figures  from  European  reports,  where  available.  Next,  the  guide 
summarizes the main considerations to be made during the preparational phase, allowing to choose 
the best possible charging infrastructure. To this end, the infrastructure will meet the demand at the 
lowest possible cost while adhering to spatial constraints and the available grid capacity. 

The most important steps in the preparational phase are to (1) establish your charging needs, to (2) 
identify charging solutions, and finally to (3) assess the depot. Throughout these steps the guide will 
also  provide  recommendations  and  tips  which  may  provide  improvements  and  savings  when 
establishing the infrastructure. 

Finally, we summarize the most important recommendations and lessons described throughout the 
guide in section six. We believe that the information provided will be useful for fleet and depot owners 
– and may accelerate the electrification of trucks in Europe. 

1. Introduction

2. Charging solutions – an overview 

2.1. Charging options for trucks 

The type of chargers chosen for a depot depends primarily on the charging power needed by the trucks 
to  fulfill  their  daily  energy  requirements  (driving,  refrigerating,  concrete  mixing,  refuse  collecting, 
etc.).  The  two  main  categories  of  charging  are  so-called  alternating  current (AC)  and  direct 
current (DC)  charging.  AC charging  is  used for  lower  charging  powers  up  to 43  kW  –  while  DC  can 
provide up to 350 kilowatts (KW) with CCS and several megawatts (MW) with MCS. While DC charging 
is more widely used and supported by trucks, and adds several additional advantages (see Section B 
below), the costs are also greater – keeping AC charging as a relevant option for lighter urban trucks. 

This part of the guide will present three important aspects to charging. (A) The charging power that 
contemporary e-trucks typically support, (B) charging levels supported by the CCS and MCS plug, and 
finally (C) examples of real chargers and their physical characteristics. 

We use the term charger to describe the entire physical asset/enclosure used to charge the vehicles. 
The term charge point is used to describe the individual outlets used to physically connect the trucks. 
Some chargers have two or more charge points allowing multiple trucks to share a single charger.  

A.  Supported charging powers in trucks today 

Different models of trucks will support different charging power levels for AC and DC charging. For 
some trucks there are different options for charging powers that can be specified at the time of order 
or that can be added as a retrofit later. It is of course important to ensure that the trucks will match 
the charging equipment in terms of power. 

Figure  1  illustrates  a  few  examples  of  contemporary  e-trucks  and  the  charging  power  that  they 
support.  

Figure 1: Examples of charging power in trucks. 

Be aware that charging of above 22 kW AC or 150-200 kW DC is less common in contemporary trucks. 
Several trucks do not support AC – while DC charging support should be seen as mandatory.

💡 

Especially for high-power charging it is common that the experienced charging power will 
be lower than the nominal charging power specified by charging equipment and truck. 
This is determined by the so-called “charging curve” of electric vehicles and is influenced 
by the temperature, the state of charge of the battery, and several other factors. 

B.  Charging levels supported by the CCS and MCS plug 

The majority of charging at depots is facilitated using the Combined Charging System (CCS) - type 2 
inlet defined by the IEC 62196 standard. The inlet allows trucks to use both AC and DC chargers using 
the same physical plug opening.  

The  same  association  who  has  promoted  CCS,  CharIN,  is  also  behind  the  development  of  a  new 
charging standard to support higher charging powers, in the Megawatt range, especially designed for 
the heavy transport sector, including trucks. The Megawatt Charging System (MCS) standard will be 
more suitable to meet the demand from trucks in situations where short parking and layover periods 
will have to support the driving needs. This is especially relevant for long-haul transport where trucks 
charge along the route – or at destinations during loading/unloading.  

Figure  2  shows  some  typical  options  for  charging  power,  the  corresponding  charging  speed,  and 
associated cost range. The charging speed is based on the nominal charging power of the charge point 
and should be considered as the maximum charging speed obtained – the typical charging speed will 
be lower, especially for higher charging powers. Costs are based on ACEA estimates7. 

• 

AC charging vs. DC charging – what’s the difference?  

💡 
•  Our common electricity system runs on alternating current (AC) which must be converted to 
direct current (DC) needed by the truck batteries. This means that a conversion from AC to 
DC needs to take place before the electric energy can be delivered to the truck battery.  
If that conversion happens in the truck we call this AC charging – the charger simply delivers 
AC power to the vehicle which then takes care of the conversion. Conversely, if the charging 
station does the conversion, it is called DC charging. 
The power components taking care of the conversion will add cost and weight – this is why 
DC chargers are typically larger and cost more. Onboard chargers are typically small (with 
relatively limited power) to save costs and weight. 
The  immediate  benefit  of  DC  charging  is  the  increase  in  charging  speed  and  the  broader 
support among trucks. Moreover, the  communication mode  used in DC charging typically 
allows for more advanced options including pre-heating, pre-conditioning, and information 
on the battery SOC.

Figure 2: AC and DC charging using CCS and MCS inlet. Charging speeds are based on an assumed consumption of 1-1.5 kWh 
per km, the maximum/nominal charging power and cost provided by “European EV Charging Infrastructure Masterplan”, 
ACEA, 2022. The placing of the inlets on the truck is for illustrative purposes only. 

In this guide, the emphasis is put charging powers between 22 kW AC and 150 kW DC charging, since 
this range represents best the needs encountered at private depots within the scope of this guide. If 
the fleet has an extraordinary charging demand and limited layover time available for charging at the 
depot – we recommend talking to a consultant about the possibility of 350 kW and MCS charging. 

In case AC chargers are sufficient to meet the demand it is also worth considering including one or a 
few DC chargers to handle special events where a more pressing need for charging arises. 

C.  Charging solution examples – placement and physical footprint 

Depending  on  the  chosen  solution,  the  physical  charging  hardware  will  have  different  dimensions 
which influence the placement and protection needed in the environment in which they are installed. 
While equipment is continuously developed and specialized to fit into many types of environments – 
depending  on  specific  user  needs  and  special  constraints  –  we  here  define  three  main  types  as 
illustrated in Figure 3, supporting either AC type-2 (Mennekes) or CCS type plugs. The main difference 
between these categories is the space they will take up at the depot and the specific placement of the 
hardware relative to the trucks.

standing DC charger (DC CCS). Source: hypercharger.it c) Satellite chargers (DC CCS). Source: kempower.com 

a)  AC/DC Charging box 

The small size of charging boxes allows for many placement options. The boxes are typically either 
mounted on a wall, or on a dedicated charging pole in sets of one-two. This design is typically used for 
AC charging – although charging boxes for DC charging are also available for moderate power levels 
(typically 50 kW). The charger in Figure 3 measures (H*W*D) 392 x 258 x 112 mm.  

b)  DC charger – free standing 

The most common solution for DC chargers is the classical free stranding version. The chargers are 
placed on the terrain relatively close to where the trucks can park. The “fridge” size of such chargers 
increases the considerations which must be made for the maneuverability of the trucks and takes up 
the  most  space  estate  compared  to  the  two  other  categories.  The  solution  illustrated  in  Figure  3 
measures (H*W*D) 2250 x 420 x 854 mm. 

c)  DC charger - Satellite 

An alternative solution is the option of collecting the power electronics in a separate enclosure which 
can be placed separately from the charging outlets themselves. This means that the charging solution 
will take up less space in the area where the trucks operate and can have advantages regarding safety 
and maneuverability. The solution shown in Figure 3 measures (H*W*D) 1500 x 300 x 300 mm. 

2.2. Diagram of typical installation  

When  building  charging  infrastructure  at  a  depot,  the  chargers  will  be  integrated  into  the  existing 
electricity installation. Figure 4 provides an overview of the components and key connection points. 
Commonly,  depots  are  connected  via  underground  cables  to  the  public  distribution  grid.  The 
connection point is equipped with an electricity meter measuring the consumption of the depot. The 
grid  connection  point  is marked  with  number  .  The  consumption  of  the  already  existing electric 
installation including all appliances is in the following referred to as the “base load”, indicated by . 
The chargers are integrated into the existing electric installation at point , which can be equipped 
with  an  electricity  meter  dedicated  to  measuring  the  aggregated  consumption  of  the  charging 
infrastructure.

One of the key questions when building charging infrastructure at a depot is if the existing electric 
installation of the building is sufficient for incorporating the additional load imposed by the chargers. 
The added consumption of the chargers at point  and the base load at point  must always be lower 
than the power rating of the grid connection point . This topic will be, among other items, discussed

3. Key questions for your depot 

Before choosing a charging solution for the depot there are a number of important questions that will 
determine the need in terms of chargers and grid connection. Having answers ready for most of these 
questions  will  help  when  going  through  the  rest  of  the  guide,  but  also  when  talking  to  potential 
subcontractors or consultants. 

Establish your 
charging needs 

Identify charging 
solutions 

1.  How many electric trucks will use the depot now and in the future? 
Make a forward-looking plan for how much of your fleet you will 
electrify and when. 

2.  What are the usage patterns of the trucks using your depot?  

Determine how long the trucks are parked at the depot and when. 

3.  What distances do the trucks drive between visiting the depot? 

Both on average and “worst-case”. 

4.  How much energy are the electric trucks spending per km driven? 
Provided by truck manufacturer, but also take practical experience 
of other fleet operators into account. 

5.  What charging power will the electric trucks be able to support for 

AC and DC charging, respectively? 
If you can customize the trucks charging options, you may first 
consider if you will charge AC or DC at the depot.  

6.  What are your long-term plans for charging opportunities at the 

depot?  
How many charging options will you ultimately need at the depot. 

Assess the depot  

7.  What is the grid connection capacity at your depot?  

If in doubt, consult an electrician and your grid company. 
8.  Are there size constraints at the depot which may limit the 

possibility of placing chargers or having the trucks access them?  
Especially free-standing DC chargers take up space and custom 
solutions may be necessary. 

9.  What regulations and safety considerations apply for the depot?  
National/regional/local and technical regulations regarding the 
installation of charging infrastructure need to be consulted. 
10. Is the depot co-located with PV or battery storage are there any 

plans for this? 
Both may decrease grid-associated costs and carbon footprint.

4. Establishing charging infrastructure – phases and costs 

This guide is meant to support the first, preparational phase of establishing charging infrastructure. 
As illustrated in Figure 5 this guide focuses on the main steps that need to be taken to assess the best 
solutions for charging. We recommend contacting the  local grid company even before making this 
assessment as the possibilities, costs and lead times that they can indicate will have a large bearing 
on the economy and time needed for the project.  

Figure 5: main phases of establishing charging infrastructure 

In the following chapter “Choosing a solution” you can read about the considerations which will go 
into  dimensioning  the  infrastructure  to  the  depot’s particular  needs  –  so you are  better equipped 
when reaching out to consultants, technicians and your grid company. 

In this section we will provide time and CapEx estimates for establishing a charging infrastructure 

4.1. Timeline for deploying charging infrastructure 

Establishing a charging infrastructure can take from a few months up to several years (worst case) 
depending on the chosen charger solutions and the grid’s ability to accommodate that demand. 

A  rise  in  demand  for  charging  infrastructure  means  that  bottlenecks  may  arise  –  and  should  be 
anticipated in the project plan. Establishing  early contact and coordination with providers (charger 
providers, technicians, grid company) will provide the depot operator with a better estimate of the 
time needed. 

The  time  it  will  take  to  establish  a  charging  infrastructure  depends  on  four  main  processes  in  the 
implementation phase8; delivery, permits, installation and potential grid extensions. 

While the duration of each process varies significantly over time and for each country/region, we here 
provide examples from Denmark to provide a rough estimate on the order of magnitude which may 
be expected.

can be carried out in parallel.  

4.2. Infrastructure CapEx 

The  main  determining  factor  to  the  CapEx  is  the  size  of  the  infrastructure  in terms of  numbers  of 
charge points and the power rating of each. Faster chargers will in general cost more and result in 
larger costs for grid upgrades. The following table present estimates for the main costs of establishing 
a  single  AC  or  DC  outlet  based  on  numbers  from  ACEA9  supplemented  by  input  from  a  Danish 
installation company.

Key remarks on costs and installation times 

A 22 kW AC charger can cost 1.5–5.5 k€ and takes up to 6 months to install, a 150 kW DC 
charger can cost 132–182 k€ and takes up to 24 months to install.  
As  such,  it  is  important  to  establish  an  early  understanding  of  the  charging  power 
requirement, as this will determine both CapEx and time needed to complete the charging 
infrastructure.  
Regardless of the charging infrastructure, depot operators should start the implementation 
process as early as possible to accommodate for possible delays and lead times in charger 
acquisition, installation, and grid upgrades.

When establishing charging infrastructure, three main steps are imperative: 

Step 1 

Step 2 

Step 3 

Establish your charging needs: First, it is essential to assess the 
charging demand of the trucks at the depot. This is done under 
consideration of  truck  properties  and operating  profile.  All  in 
all, this step estimates energy needs and power consumption of 
each truck. 

Identify charging solutions: This step aims at identifying charger 
types that are suitable for fulfilling the charging demand of the 
trucks,  as  well  as  determining  the  corresponding  number  of 
charge points needed at the depot. 

Assess the depot: To fulfill the energy needs of the trucks, the 
grid connection capacity and space requirements at the depot 
need to be assessed. This step analyses how the depot can be 
prepared to accomplish the shift to electric trucks. 

Figure 6: Establishing charging infrastructure in three steps. 

The following subsections provide detailed information on each of the three steps. Although the steps 
build up on each other, the overall methodology is still considered part of the preparation phase. This 
means that decisions on the charging solution should only be made after the assessment of all three 
steps. For clarifying the theoretical aspects, an exemplary fleet profile is used to demonstrate each 
step.  

5.1. Establish your charging demand 

To  determine  the  charging  demand  of  a  single  truck,  the  daily  driving  distance  (in  km)  and  the 
 of the truck is 
consumption of the truck (in kWh/km) need to be considered. The energy demand 
calculated as: 

𝐸

While the driving distance is usually well known by the fleet operator, the consumption of the truck 
𝐸 =  𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ⋅ 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑎𝑢𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑟𝑦
can be provided by the truck manufacturer. However, like for diesel trucks, the actual consumption 
can differ from the stated values. For this reason, practical experience and test drives can help identify 
the realistic truck consumption and provide important insights, since the consumption can largely vary 
with the driving style. If present, auxiliary systems of the truck should also be taken into account, for 
instance, refrigeration, concrete mixing, or refuse collecting. 

The energy charged at the depot cannot exceed the usable battery capacity of the truck. For instance, 
if  the  daily  driving  distance  is  larger  than  the  maximum  vehicle  range,  public  chargers  or  charging 
opportunities at logistic centers need to be used in addition to depot charging. In these cases, the

considerations for depot charging only take into account the truck’s battery capacity as the energy 
demand, and not the overall consumption between depot charging.  

Once the energy demand of a truck is known, the minimum charging power that needs to be provided 
 (in 
at the depot is calculated. The calculation is based on the truck’s energy demand at the depot, 
kWh), the time at the depot 
 (in hours), and the charging efficiency 

 (in percent):

The minimum power 
 indicates the power a truck would need to charge continuously at during 
its time at the depot to fulfill the energy needs. The equation shows that for shorter layover times at 
the depot, the required power level increases. Furthermore, the efficiency 
 takes into account the 
power losses in charger and truck battery. With lower efficiency, more energy needs to be provided 
by  the  depot  to  compensate  for  the  losses  during  the  charging  process.  The  charging  efficiency 
depends on various factors such as the specific battery type, the charger type, and charging power. 
To provide a simple figure, we recommend calculating with an efficiency of 90%.  

𝜂

💡 

In case the fleet comprises different types of trucks and/or different operating profiles, 
the method should be applied to each truck group individually. This is necessary since the 
different trucks might require different chargers to fulfill their individual energy needs.

5.2. Identify charging solutions 

The decision on the charging infrastructure layout centers around two main questions, addressing 
the type and the number of charge points. 

1)  What type of chargers are needed? 

 per truck was estimated, as well as the minimum charging 
In the previous step the energy need 
power 
.  This  power  corresponds  to  continuous  charging  between  arrival  and  departure.  The 
power  rating  of  the  charger  should  clearly  exceed  this  value  to  ensure  that  the  truck  reaches  its 
energy needs with a sufficient time buffer before departure.  

𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑛

𝐸

The time buffer should be considered for several reasons. First, if the truck arrives late at the depot, 
the charger has less time to provide the required energy. Second, in case of increased energy needs 
on single days, e.g., due to traffic or unanticipated detours, the charger must recharge more energy 
in the given layover time at the depot. Third, a truck commonly reduces the charging power when 
the  battery  approaches  its  upper  charge  limit.  Hence,  the  average  charging  power  of  a  charging 
process is lower than the rated power of the charger.  

When  selecting  an  AC  charger,  the  rated  power  should  be  at  least  50%  more  than  the  minimum 
average power calculated in step 1: 

𝑃𝐴𝐶 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟 > 1.5 ⋅ 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑛
When selecting a DC charger, the rated power should be at least double the minimum average power 
calculated in step 1: 

𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟 > 2 ⋅ 𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑛
The reason for this distinction lies in the overall higher power rating at DC chargers. Generally, trucks 
will  reduce  their  charging power when their  battery approaches  100%  SOC.  At high  power  levels, 
which  are  experienced  at  fast  chargers,  the  truck  will  reduce  the  charging  power  from  an  earlier 
charge level, requiring a larger time buffer.  

It should be noted that the values for 
 are minimum requirements for the 
 and 
power rating of the charge points. The rating can also be chosen higher to achieve more flexibility for 
shifting  the  charging  processes  to  preferable  time  windows,  for  instance,  to  periods  with  lower 
electricity prices. Besides  considerations on both investment  and operating costs  for the  charging

5. Choosing a solution

infrastructure, it is indispensable to assess the existing electric installation at the depot including the 
grid connection capacity, which is further addressed in Section 5.3. 

Another crucial aspect in the selection of suitable chargers is compatibility with the truck properties. 
For instance, assuming a truck can charge up to 22 kW at an AC charger, and up to 150 kW at a DC 
charger: If 
 was estimated at 25 kW, only DC charge points with 50 kW or more are suitable. In 
this example, AC charge points of 43 kW are not suitable since the truck would only charge at 22kW 
and therefore not reach the energy needs.  

𝑃𝑚𝑖𝑛

2)  How many charge points are needed? 

The number of charge points depends to a large extent on the fleet size, but is also influenced by their 
coincidence factor at the depot, i.e., if they are using the depot at the same time. For fleets with a 
homogeneous schedule where all trucks arrive and leave at the same time, a truck/charge point ratio 
of 1:1 is needed, meaning that there is one functional charge point per truck. For fleets where the 
trucks have different operating schedules the number of charge points may be chosen to be less than 
the  number  of  trucks,  presuming  that  their  schedules  allow  to  use  the  same  charge  points 
consecutively.  

Special  considerations  apply  to  DC  chargers,  which  are  often  built  with  two  charge  points 
(connectors/plugs) per charger. In this case, one charger can be used by two trucks simultaneously. 
When  selecting  the  charger  rating,  it  is  important  to  consider  that  each  of  the  charge  points  can 
provide the power levels required for fulfilling the trucks’ charging needs. Assuming a scenario where 
. In this case, a DC 
the minimum power rating for the charger was estimated as 
charger with two connectors à 75 kW can charge two trucks simultaneously. Hence, the total power 
rating of the DC charger is 150 kW.  

𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟 = 60 kW

In case AC chargers are sufficient to meet the demand it is also worth considering installing one or 
more  high-power  DC  chargers,  depending  on the  fleet  size.  This  can  help  to  handle  special  events 
where a more pressing need for charging arises for individual trucks.  

💡 

Heterogeneous fleets with diverse truck types and/or operating profiles might require a 
mix of AC and DC chargers. 

CASE – exemplary fleet profile 

In the previous step the minimum average charging power of the truck at the depot was estimated 
as 

 This value corresponds to continuous charging between arrival and departure.  

9.8 kW.

The  power  rating  of  the  charge  point  should  clearly  exceed  this 
value to ensure that the truck reaches the required energy with a 
sufficient  time  buffer.  The  minimum  power  rating  of  the  charge 
point is estimated as 

𝑃𝐴𝐶 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟 > 1.5 ⋅ 9.8 kW = 14.7 kW
In the present example, an AC charge point with a rated power of 
22 kW  is  suitable  for  fulfilling  the  charging  needs.  A  charge  point

with a rated power of 11 kW should not be considered, as it does not provide a sufficient time 
buffer in case of delayed arrivals at the depot or an increased energy demand due to unanticipated 
detours. The  following figure  shows  the truck charging profile  at a 22 kW AC charge  point. The 
truck arrives at the depot at 17:00 and leaves at 7:00 the next morning. The charging process is

Figure 7: Charging profile of a single truck at a 22 kW AC charge point. 

For the fleet of 5 trucks, a total of 5 AC charge points with a rated power of 22 kW each are needed. 
This corresponds to a truck/charge point ratio of 1:1. The aggregated consumption of all charging 
processes is crucial to assess in relation to the available grid connection capacity, which is addressed 
in the following section. 

5.3. Assess the depot 

To facilitate the successful implementation of charging infrastructure at a depot, both electrical and 
spatial  requirements  need  to  be  considered.  This  step  addresses  related  questions  and  further 
provides recommendations for the management and operation of the depot. 

1) 

Is the grid connection sufficient? 

When installing charging infrastructure at a depot, it is crucial to assess if the existing grid capacity is 
sufficient  to  incorporate  the  demand  added  by  the  chargers,  under  consideration  of  the  already 
existing consumption at the depot. Assuming the “worst case” of simultaneous charging at the rated 
power of all chargers, the maximum total added load is calculated as 

𝑃𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑔 = 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟𝑠 ⋅ 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟
The  grid  connection  capacity  must  be  able  to  satisfy  both  the  charging  needs  and  the  base  load 
consisting of the other appliances of the depot (e.g., lights, air conditioning units), as introduced in 
Section 2.2.  If  the  additional  load  imposed  by  the  added  charging  infrastructure  cannot  be 
incorporated  in  the  existing  electric  installation  of  the  depot,  the  grid  connection  needs  to  be 
upgraded.  It  is  noteworthy  that  grid  connection  upgrades  commonly  entail  significant  investment 
costs for equipment and installation, as well as higher grid connection fees to the distribution grid 
operator  (Section 4).  Due  to the  high  costs,  it  is  essential  to consider  solutions for minimizing  grid 
connection upgrades. This includes load management systems, which ensure that the collective power 
consumption of all chargers always stays below a certain limit – and that the available power is shared 
among the trucks.  

💡 

Battery  and  photovoltaic  systems  can  reduce  both  the  grid  impact  and  the  operating 
costs. The battery system can be charged during hours with low electricity prices and with 
locally produced energy, and later discharged to cover parts of the truck demand.

CASE – exemplary fleet profile 

In the present example we assume a grid capacity of the depot of 43 kW. This corresponds to a 
standard 3 phase grid connection of 230V and 63A.  

The  following  figure  illustrates  the  base  load  by  other  appliances,  aggregated with  the charging 
processes of the 5 trucks, assuming immediate charging after arrival at the depot. The trucks add 
 to the base load. As visible in the figure, the existing grid 
an additional load of 
capacity of 43 kW is not sufficient to incorporate the additional load imposed by truck charging. 
Assuming a maximum base load of 15 kW during the time of truck charging, the grid connection 
must  be  increased  to  at  least  125  kW,  which  is  approximately  three  times  the  current  grid 
connection.  

5 ⋅ 22 kW = 110 kW

The need for large grid connection upgrades can be reduced by using load management solutions 
for the chargers. This allows to actively control and coordinate the charging processes of all trucks, 
utilizing the temporal flexibility of the charging processes. The effect is also demonstrated in the 
following  figure.  By  shifting  the  energy  consumption  of  the  chargers,  the  overall  power 
consumption at the depot can be kept below a given threshold, in the given example below 70 kW. 
Despite the imposed power limit, the charging processes are finished around 2h before departure.

Figure 8: Truck charging with load management. The peak consumption can be effectively mitigated by shifting the load 
to later times, reducing the need for extensive grid upgrades. 

To  facilitate  load  management,  it  is  important  to  select  chargers  that  comply  with  application 
protocols,  such  as  OCPP  (Open  Charge  Point  Protocol).  The  protocol  allows  chargers  and  central 
management systems to communicate with each other. This is particularly important if the chargers 
are from different manufacturers.  

Besides limiting the overall power consumption to a desired threshold, load management solutions 
offer additional advantages. The controllability of the individual charging processes allows to shift the 
charging to preferable time windows, for instance, to hours with low electricity prices, or to hours of 
own solar production. This can reduce operating costs, especially with fluctuating electricity prices. As 
previously highlighted in Section 5.2, the temporal flexibility can be increased by selecting chargers

𝑃𝐴𝐶 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑟

 and 

The higher the power level of the chargers, the higher the flexibility to shift the charging processes to 
low-price  time  windows,  which  reduces  operating  costs.  However,  the  investment  costs  for  the 
chargers  are  higher, as  illustrated  in  Section 4.  Furthermore,  the  grid  connection capacity  must  be 
suitable for utilizing this flexibility. Potential upgrades of the grid connection increase investment costs 
and may entail a significant implementation period. Moreover, preventing high power consumption 
at the grid connection point effectively reduces operating costs in case network charges to utilities 
consider  the  peak  power  during  a  given  billing  period.  All  in  all,  the  optimal  power  rating  of  the 
chargers depends on various factors, which are location-specific and might change over time (e.g., 
electricity  prices,  tariffs).  In  this  context,  the  minimum  required  power  rating  derived  in  Step  2 
(Section 5.2) provides a lower bound to identify technically feasible solutions. 

2) 

What are the space and safety requirements at the depot? 

When planning the installation of charging infrastructure at a depot, space and safety requirements 
must be taken into account. The considerations center around the following aspects:  

•  The  installation  of  chargers  requires  sufficient  space  for  both  the  actual  hardware  and  the 
accessibility of the trucks to the chargers. Considerations regarding the trucks’ maneuverability 
at the depot are imperative, so parking and swing-out collisions are avoided. 

•  The exact charger position next to the truck’s parking spot must be chosen carefully. The position 
of the plug inlet must be considered at the correct side (left/right), and with the correct distance 
from the front of the truck. 

•  Technical standards regarding the installation of charging infrastructure must be consulted. This 
concerns aspects such as maximum and minimum distances between technical components, or 
compliance with EMC (electro-magnetic compatibility) requirements. 

•  That  depot  must  comply  with  national,  regional,  and  local  regulations  related  to  charging 
infrastructure and parking of electric vehicles. It is recommended to get in dialogue with local 
entities such as fire brigades. 
Insurance  policies  should  be  checked  for  specific  requirements  concerning  charging 
infrastructure.  

• 

💡 

When electrifying only parts of the fleet, it is worth considering to already prepare the 
underground infrastructure (cable tube) for additional chargers.

3) 

Management and operation 

After  assessing  the  depot  with  respect  to  electrical,  spatial,  and  environmental  requirements,  a 
decision  is  to  be  made  whether  the  installation  of  charging  infrastructure  is  feasible  at  the  given 
location. If not, it should be considered to move the depot site to a different location that can meet 
the requirements. 

To ensure smooth fleet management, information on the charging processes of the individual trucks 
can be linked to the fleet management software used for planning and monitoring the fleet operation. 
In  this  way,  the  fleet operator  receives  updated  information  on  the  status  of each  truck,  e.g.,  the 
connection  status  (not  connected/plugged-in/charging),  the  charge  level,  and  the  estimated  time 
when charging will be completed. 

Closely tied to the selection of charging infrastructure and software solution is whether to contract 
with a charge point operator (CPO). CPOs are companies which are specialized in providing, installing, 
and  operating  charging  equipment.  The  equipment  can  either  be  owned  by  the  CPO  or  they  can 
operate  the  equipment  on  behalf  of  a  third  party  (e.g.  the  depot  operator).  While  it  is  generally 
recommended that the depot has ownership of the hardware, it might make sense to let the technical 
operation and maintenance to an external company. This can either be a CPO or another company 
with  the  necessary  technical  expertise.  The  tradeoff  is  that  the  CPO  can  provide  a  package  which 
simplifies the infrastructure acquisition and operation – but that adds operational costs long-term.  

With the current electricity mix, the LCA emissions of electric trucks are already better than the ones 
of  diesel  trucks  and  continue  to  improve  with  increasing  shares  of  renewables  and  improved 
production practices for battery cells. To further decrease their carbon footprint, fleet operators can 
select electricity retailers who offer green electricity options.  

💡 

It is worth to consider offering public access to the chargers during times when trucks are 
on duty. If larger parts of the fleet are driving during the day and returning to the depot 
in the evening, the idle infrastructure could be operated as public chargers offering an 
additional source of income.

5.4. Selected cases  

The methodology presented in Section 5 was applied to various fleet profiles, shown in Table 2. The 
blue section of the table summarizes the inputs and assumptions for each fleet. In addition to the 
operating schedule, exemplary truck properties such as the battery capacity and maximum charging 
powers were made. The green section of the table presents the results obtained by applying the three-
step methodology from Section 5. If the driving demand exceeds the battery capacity of the truck, 
additional  charging  along  the  way  is  necessary,  as  previously  highlighted  in  Section 5.1.  For  the 
calculation of the results, it was assumed that the fleet has a homogeneous schedule, i.e., all trucks 
have similar arrival and departure times. The selected DC chargers power levels were assumed with 
incremental steps of 25 kW. It is noteworthy that different manufacturers offer different product lines 
that may provide finer steps for the power rating. For the calculation of the total charging cluster load 
two  values  are  given.  The  first  value  (“max”)  indicates  the  maximum  power  consumption  of  the 
charging  infrastructure  assuming  all  trucks  are  charging  simultaneously.  The  second  value  (“min”) 
provides a lower bound of the possible power consumption, under the ideal assumption that a load 
management system is used to control the charging processes of the different trucks.

6. Summary – main recommendations  

1.  Establish your 
charging needs 

✓  Determine how many trucks will use the depot now and in the future. Identify key truck 

properties, such as the battery capacity and possible charging power levels. 

✓  Find the energy needed by the trucks at your depot, based on how much they drive and 

2. Identify 
charging solutions 

consume between depot stops.  

✓  You can then calculate the average power needed to meet the energy demand, in order 

to understand which power levels the chargers should support. 

  In case the fleet comprises different types of trucks and/or different operating profiles, 

the trucks might require different chargers to fulfill their individual energy needs. 

✓  Choose a charger type with a power rating at least 1.5 times (AC) or 2 times (DC) higher 

than your average power demand estimated in the previous step. 

✓  As a simple rule, we recommend one charge point per truck. However, if parts of the fleet 
have  opposing  schedules,  the  number  of  charge  points  may  be  chosen  lower  than  the 
number of trucks. 

✓  Select  chargers  with  smart  charging  capability.  This  allows  to  control  the  charging 

infrastructure through a load management system. 

  Especially for high-power charging it is common that the experienced charging power will 
be lower than the nominal charging power specified by the charging equipment and truck. 
  AC charging is cheaper than DC,  and may  primarily  be  sufficient  for  use  cases  in  urban 
areas.  For  higher  charging  demand,  we  recommend  DC  charging  due  to  additional 
advantages in terms of charging powers and communication capabilities.  

  Heterogeneous fleets with diverse truck types and/or operating profiles might require a 

mix of AC and DC chargers. 

3. Assess the 
depot 

✓  The grid company should be contacted immediately to discuss potential grid connection 
limitations. Upgrading the grid may take a significant amount of time to complete and has 
a considerable cost associated with it. 

✓  Determine  if  the  grid  connection  capacity  is  sufficient  to  support  the  charging 

infrastructure. 

✓  A load management system may reduce the grid capacity costs significantly. On the other 
hand, underinvesting in grid capacity while relying on load management too heavily might 
constrain  future  extensions  of  the  depot,  and  further  reduces  the  flexibility  for  smart 
charging.  
It is important to identify potential size constraints at the depot which may impact the 
placement of chargers. Similarly, the access to the chargers needs to be assessed, taking 
into account the maneuverability of the trucks. 

✓ 

✓  Consult  technical  and  safety  regulations  regarding  the 
infrastructure, as well as implications on insurance policies. 
It  is  worth  considering  delegating  the  operation  and  maintenance  to  a  charge  point 
operator. 

installation  of  charging 

✓ 

  Battery systems and PVs are highly  complementary. Investigate the potential of adding 

these to the depot. 

  Be  aware  of  national  requirements  regarding  the  installation  of  chargers  and  make  a 

proactive plan for having enough to fulfill both legislation and your own needs. 

  When installing the  first  chargers, prepare  underground channels,  tubes,  and cables so 

you may continuously add chargers.
