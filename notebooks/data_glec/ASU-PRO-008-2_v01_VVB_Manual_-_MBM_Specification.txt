Validation and Verification Body Manual - MBM Specification 

Edition: 01  I  Date: 30-09-24  I  A Smart Freight Centre initiative 

1.  Introduction 

1.1.  The  Smart  Freight  Centre  Conformity  Assurance  Scheme  (SFC  CAS)  for  'Validation  and 
Verification  of  GHG  emissions  statements  for  transport  chains'  provides  a  global  scheme  for 
independent  verification  of  GHG  emissions.  It  is  based  on  the  requirements  set  out  in  ISO 
standards as well as others that are specific to the SFC scheme as outlined in Section 4.  

1.2. The SFC CAS defines two technical scopes:  

1.2.1. ISO 14083 Scope: covered in the Validation and Verification Body Manual – ISO 
14083 (SFC-PRO-002-2).  

1.2.2. Market Based Measures (MBM) Specification Scope: covered in this document. 

1.3.  The  Validation  and  Verification  Body  Manual  –  MBM  Specification  (this  document) 
provides the specific criteria and procedures under which a Validation and Verification Body (VVB) 
becomes  approved  (and  maintains  approval)  for  the  MBM  Specification  Scope.  It  also  covers 
procedures  that  must  be  followed  by  VVBs  when  providing  verification  services,  as  well  as  for 
qualification of individual verifiers.   

1.4. Given that any VVB wanting to be approved for the MBM Specification Scope must already 
be SFC approved for the ISO 14083 Scope, this document shall only contain requirements that 
are not already covered in the VVB Manual – ISO 14083 (SFC-PRO-002-2).   

1.5. This procedure becomes effective on the date of issue indicated above. 

2.  Scope and applicability 

2.1. This document is applicable to all VVBs seeking to conduct verifications as part of the SFC 
CAS for the MBM Specification Scope. Specifically, this document contains:   

2.1.1. Procedures for a VVB to apply for (and maintain) approval as an SFC VVB for the 
MBM Specification Scope as an extension to its approved scope for the ISO 14083 Scope,   
2.1.2.  Procedures  for  individuals  to  be  approved  as  SFC-qualified  verification  personnel, 
and maintain their SFC approval for the MBM Specification Scope,  
2.1.3.  Procedures  for  a  VVB  to  carry  out  verification  activities  against  the  MBM 
Specification.

[Title] 

2.2. For VVBs the MBM Specification Scope is additional in addition to the ISO 14083 Scope and 
cannot  be  applied  on  its  own.  Therefore,  normative  documents  listed  under  Article  3.1.A  are  in 
supplementary to the normative documents listed under Article 3.4 of document ASU-PRO-002-2. 

2.3. Participation in the SFC CAS is voluntary and based on objective criteria. The scheme is not 
discriminatory to ERs or VVBs. 

3.  Documents 

3.1. The following are normative documents (i.e., standards) for the MBM Specification Scope:  

A. 

Reporting standards: 

3.1.1.  SFC-SPEC-001  MBM  Specification  -  Market  Based  Measures  Specification  for 
Logistics Emissions Reporting 

B. 

Verification standards: 

3.1.2.  ISO  17029,  Conformity  Assessment  –  General  principles  and  requirements  for 
Validation and Verification Bodies  

3.1.3. ISO 14065, General principles and requirements for bodies validating and verifying 
environmental information 

3.1.4.  ISO  14064-3,  Greenhouse  gases  –  Part  3:  Specification  with  guidance  for  the 
verification and validation of greenhouse gas statements  

3.1.5. ISO 14066, Greenhouse gases – Competence requirements for validation teams and 
verification teams 

3.2.  The  standards  listed  above  are  part  of  the  requirements  of  the  SFC  CAS,  and  their 
requirements shall be met either by the ER (set A above) or the VVB (set B above). 

C. 

Guidance: 

3.3. The required scheme documents are complemented by guidance documents, which provide 
additional information to assist with the interpretation of standards - these are mentioned explicitly 
in the MBM Specification (SFC-SPEC-001) and/or published on the SFC website. An example of 
a guidance document is the MBM Framework (SFC-GUID-002). Reporters are expected to follow 
the recognized guidance or explain to their VVB why they have not and/or that the guidance they 
have followed is more robust. 

D. 

Definitions: 

3.4. Definitions as set out in ISO 17000 and the ISO standards referenced above apply to the SFC 
CAS.

Scope of Approval and Fees 

4. 
4.1. The type of claims to be subject to verification are: the data reported on the nature of the MBM, 
associated  emissions  and  intensity  values,  dates  of  generation,  booking  and  claiming,  and 
individual Solutions or LETS listed.  This data relates to the specific transport chain being reported 
under ISO14083 for the SFC CAS. The criteria against which the claim is to be assessed are listed 
in Section 3B.   

4.2. Approval of VVBs extension for the MBM Specification Scope is given for a worldwide scope 
for a set period.  

4.3.  SFC  charges  fees  to  cover  administration  costs,  at  the  rates  set  out  in  the  document 
Assurance Fees for VVBs (ASU-FEE-001-2).    

5.  Approval of VVBs 

5.1.  Approval  will  only  be  granted  to  a  legal  entity  registered  under  applicable  national  laws, 
irrespective of whether the entire organization or a part of it performs verification services.  

5.2. VVBs are eligible to provide verification services under the MBM Specification Scope if they 
have already been approved by SFC for the ISO 14083 Scope.  

5.3. An approved VVB shall maintain their SFC Approval for the ISO 14083 Scope. Failure to do 
so shall result in the immediate suspension and revocation of its MBM Specification Approval. The 
reverse does not apply.  

5.4. To apply for Approval for the extension to the MBM Specification Scope, organizations must 
complete the VVB application form (ASU-TPL-002-2) and submit the signed application, along 
with  all  supporting  evidence  and  declarations  mentioned 
to 
assurance@smartfreightcentre.org.  

the  application 

form 

in 

5.5. Applicants must sign the License Agreement SFC-VVB (ASU-TPL-008-2). Applicants must 
also pay the application fee defined in the fee schedule. The application shall only be considered 
when SFC has received all the documentation  

5.6. The approval process applied by SFC for the extension to the MBM Specification Scope is the 
same  as  described  in  section  5  of  the  VVB  Manual  -  ISO  14083  (SFC-PRO-002-2),  with  the 
relevant adaptations.   

5.7. VVBs can apply without having verifiers who are approved for the MBM Specification, but the 
application  cannot be approved until they have  two  approved  verifiers  as  detailed  in  Section  6. 
Until this happens, SFC can issue an “in principle approval”, which documents that this is the only 
element that is missing.

Verification Personnel 

6.1. Requirements for verifiers evaluating the MBM Specification under the SFC CAS are the same 
as those specified in section 6 of the VVB Manual – ISO 14083, with the relevant adaptations. To 
apply under the MBM Specification Scope, individual verifiers shall already be approved under the 
ISO 14083 Scope.   

6.2.  In  addition,  a  verifier  shall  have  the  competence  required  to  assess  the  compliance  of  the 
MBM statement or calculation tools against all applicable requirements, including:  

6.2.1.  Knowledge  of  all  applicable  standards  that  constitute  criteria  for  verifying  claims 
against (e.g. SFC-SPEC-001),   
6.2.2. Knowledge of all applicable SFC requirements and procedures.    

6.3. A verifier shall also have knowledge of market-based approaches to emission accounting and 
reporting, including:   

6.3.1. Chain of custody models including: mass balance, book and claim,  
6.3.2. Claim integrity issues including: vintage, additionality, data and calculation biases,  
6.3.3.  Registries  and  the  tracking  and  tracing  of  attributes/characteristics,  including 
emissions profile integrity,  
6.3.4. Low emission transportation solution certification (i.e., fuel),  
6.3.5. Judgement of use case related data relevance and granularity.  

7. 
Verification Process 
7.1.  Planning the verification 

7.1.1. Requirements for planning of verifications of reporting under the MBM Specification are the 
same  as  those  specified  in  Section  7  of  the  VVB  Manual  –  ISO  14083,  with  the  relevant 
adaptations.  Set out below are additional requirements needed for the MBM Specification Scope, 
or  clarifications  as  to  how  an  element  of  verification  standards  listed  in  Article  3.1.B  are  to  be 
applied for the scope.  

7.1.2. Before commencing a verification engagement, the VVB  will establish the objectives and 
confirm the type of claim to be verified as outlined under Article 4.1.  This is known as the subject 
matter of the report.  

7.1.3. Criteria are the set of requirements against which the MBM Emissions Report is verified: for 
the  MBM  Specification  Scope,  this  refers  to  the  relevant  requirements  of  SFC-SPEC-001  as 
documented in the Emissions Reporter’s MBM Monitoring Plan.￼1,2￼. 

1 This Monitoring Plan can be part of the Monitoring plan for the ISO14083 compliant report (see Footnote 2), or a separate document. 
2 Both ISO14064-1 and ISO14083 are context specific, so not all elements will apply to an individual Emissions Reporter. Therefore, the Reporter 
is required to compile a Monitoring Plan that details the elements that are applied in their context. Verifiers will check both the content of the

[Title] 

7.1.4. The level of assurance and materiality shall be established in discussion with the ER. The 
justification for the level of assurance shall be documented by the VVB in the Verification Opinion. 

7.2.  Carrying out the verification 

7.2.1.  Once  a  contractual  agreement  has  been  reached  -  and  a  competent  verification  team 
selected - the VVB is required to follow the steps included in section 6 of ISO 14064-3 to carry out 
the verification itself. Subsequently the VVB shall follow sections 8, 9 and 10 of ISO 14064-3.  

7.2.2. In the first year of the first verification cycle, the VVB shall visit the main location(s) where 
MBM calculations are conducted and where records are stored. Over time, and for the same type 
of subject matter and reporting cycle, circumstances may justify that verifications can be conducted 
remotely because none of the relevant criteria mentioned in ISO 14064-3 in relation to waiver of 
site visit are met.  

7.2.3. Verification of the reported MBM data shall focus on:  

7.2.3.1.  The  appropriate  selection  of  MBM  activities  relevant  to  the  Transport  Operation 
Category (TOC) reported,  
7.2.3.2. Correct use of input data sources and the correct calculation of MBM data in relation 
to emissions, intensity etc. including plausibility checks of inputs values,   
7.2.3.3. The appropriateness of the selected chain of custody system, and the parameters 
being tracked,  
7.2.3.4. The appropriate selection of dates to be reported for vintage,   
7.2.3.5. The appropriate application of modal, additionality and double counting constraints.  

 7.2.4.  Regarding  the  responsibility  for  acceptance  of  inputs  considered  as  part  of  verification 
activities:  

7.2.4.1. Conformity assessment results generated prior to the engagement or provided by 
the client can be  accepted by the  VVB with no further verification needed, provided they 
have been verified in a manner consistent with SFC requirements and a verification report 
provides the adequate level of detail about the basis of the opinion.  
7.2.4.2. Solutions certificates from solution certification systems3 may be relied upon, but 
their scope and validity shall be checked using the mechanisms provided by the relevant 
scheme owner (e.g. online databases).  
7.2.4.3. Formal output(s) from Registries for tracking and tracing emissions characteristics 
may be relied upon. 

7.2.5.  Clauses  7.3.5  to  7.3.9  of  the  VVB  Manual  -  ISO 14083  shall  be  applied  as  appropriately 
adapted, including the specific adaptations described in the following clauses.   

7.2.6.  Under  clause  7.3.7  of  the  VVB  Manual  -  ISO  14083,  the  same activities  are  expected  in 
planning and carrying out the verification except for:  

Monitoring Plan against the CAS ISO 14083 and MBM requirements; AND the implementation of the Monitoring Plan to confirm that emissions 
calculations and MBM data are conformant with all three documents.
