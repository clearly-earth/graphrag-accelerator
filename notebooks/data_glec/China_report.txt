Executive Summary 

Freight trucks continue to be a major source of transportation CO2 emissions, and there is increasing pressure 
to decarbonize its operations to achieve global climate goals. The need for deploying sustainable solutions at 
scale  could  never  be  more  urgent.  Electrification  of  heavy-duty  trucks  offers  a  promising  pathway  towards 
decarbonization, and the rapidly expanding electric vehicle market provides a unique opportunity for large-
scale action.  

With an increase in electric truck model availability and applications, more options are available when looking 
to electrify. This is in part due to government regulations and incentives and improving production economics 
due to market certainty. Still, several challenges remain in the path towards the mass deployment of electric 
trucks. One key challenge, as with any new technology, is a high learning curve for users to understand and 
adjust  to  the  capabilities  and  economics  of  electric  trucks.  While  this  may  be  viewed  purely  as  a  technical 
problem, the challenge derives from determining new operational profiles that are needed to maximize the 
benefits from electric trucks. The only way to meaningfully rectify this is through on-the-ground testing, building 
collaborative models across different actors and having carriers and industry partners deploy electric trucks 
within their existing operational models and evaluate the need for new ones. 

The  Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou  (SDH)  deployment  project,  initiated  and  coordinated  by  SFC  China, 
addresses this challenge. This report presents the motivation, challenges and actions carried out to develop 
and initiate the project, as well as an overview of the stages required to plan, execute and evaluate the project. 
In  addition,  a  summary  recap  of  the  lessons  learned  throughout  the  process  will  enable  others  to  view 
recommendations to replicate similar projects and expand to other regions of China.  

The SDH pilot project underscored the importance of collaborative efforts among government bodies, private 
enterprises,  and  infrastructure  providers  in  overcoming  the  operational,  financial,  and  environmental 
challenges of transitioning to zero-emission freight solutions. 

§  Operationally, the pilot highlighted the suitability of electric trucks for sub-300 km daily logistics operations 
and  showcased  how  strategic  placement  of  charging  and  battery-swapping  infrastructure  can  ensure 
operational  continuity.  However,  gaps  in  infrastructure  density  and  design—such  as  the  need  for  truck-
specific charging stations—indicate areas requiring immediate attention for future projects. 

§  Financially,  the  total  cost  of  ownership  (TCO)  analysis  revealed  varying  outcomes,  with  high-mileage 
operations achieving economic competitiveness while low-mileage operations facing barriers to cost parity. 
These  findings  emphasize  the  importance  of  optimizing  vehicle  deployment  on  routes  that  maximize 
operational mileage and leveraging economies of scale to drive down costs. 

§  Environmentally, the pilot project achieved significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions. As China’s 
energy grid continues to decarbonize, the environmental benefits of electric trucks will become even more 
pronounced, making them a cornerstone of sustainable freight systems. 

Looking  ahead,  the  success  of  the  SDH  pilot  sets  the  stage  for  expanding  zero-emission  freight  corridors 
across  China.  Strategic  regions,  including  the  Pearl  River  Delta,  the  Yangtze  River  Delta,  and  the  Beijing-
Tianjin-Hebei  area,  have  been  identified  as  prime  candidates  for  electrification  due  to  their  dense  logistics 
networks and significant freight volumes. Building upon the lessons from SDH, these corridors can integrate 
scalable  charging  infrastructure,  battery-swapping  networks,  and  policy  incentives  to  facilitate  widespread 
adoption. 

For instance, the proposed Shenzhen-Hong Kong Cross-Border Fresh Produce Corridor and the East Port 
Zero-Emission  Corridor  exemplify  targeted  initiatives  aimed  at  optimizing  freight  efficiency  and  promoting 
sustainability.  Future  expansions  should  prioritize  high-density  logistics  hubs  and  intercity  freight  corridors, 
leveraging  data-driven  planning  to  align  infrastructure  development  with  transport  demands.  Collaborative 
policy frameworks, such as relaxing road restrictions for electric trucks and providing financial incentives, will 
be critical in scaling these efforts. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, regional integration will play a key role in achieving nationwide impacts. For example, connecting 
electrified corridors across provinces and linking them with major ports, airports, and railway hubs can establish 
a  comprehensive  zero-emission  logistics  network.  By  fostering  partnerships  between  stakeholders  at  all 
levels—government, private sector, and academia—China can create a robust ecosystem that accelerates the 
transition to zero-emission freight solutions. 

The outcomes of the SDH pilot not only pave the way for electrification within China but also offer a replicable 
model for other countries and regions. With continued innovation, investment, and stakeholder engagement, 
zero-emission freight systems can be scaled globally, contributing significantly to achieving net-zero logistics 
and aligning with international climate goals. 

 
 
 
 
 
Smart Freight Centre China 

The Smart Freight Centre (SFC) is an international non-profit organization focused on reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions from freight transportation. Its mission is to accelerate the reduction of logistics emissions by 
fostering collaboration within the global logistics ecosystem. SFC mobilizes global shippers to track and reduce 
emissions towards net-zero carbon by 2050. This is done through three selected core strategies. 

1.  By  setting  global  standards  for  emission  accounting  in  logistics  and  maintaining  recognition  as  a  global 

authority to enable validation and impacting/tracking; 

2.  By creating and scaling capacity building programs within the logistics ecosystem in partnerships, with a 

focus to spread implementation of standards, foster collaboration, and support impact; and,  

3.  By shaping collaborative initiative’s for action, focusing on high impact scalable decarbonization levers, that 

require joint action across the logistics ecosystem.  

This project has been led by SFC China and focuses on SFC’s third core strategy – collaborating initiatives for 
action.  China  is  at  the  forefront  of  global  truck  electrification  efforts,  demonstrating  significant  progress  in 
vehicle  and  battery  technology,  market  development,  and  research  into  innovative  solutions  like  battery 
swapping.  Despite  these  advancements,  the  actual  uptake  of  electric  trucks  in  China's  road  freight  sector 
remains  below  1%  of  the  total  vehicle  stock,  highlighting  the  need  for  continued  efforts  to  accelerate  the 
transition to electric trucks and overcome existing barriers to their implementation. 

Zero Emission Freight Initiative 

The Zero Emission Freight Initiative (ZEFI) is a non-profit, collaborative partnership dedicated to accelerating 
the adoption of zero-emission trucks in China. Supported by the Energy Foundation, ZEFI brings together a 
diverse  range  of  stakeholders,  including  research  institutions,  OEMs,  energy  providers,  shippers,  logistics 
companies, and industry associations. By fostering collaboration, promoting supportive policies, and building 
consensus on zero-emission freight pathways, ZEFI aims to drive the transition towards a cleaner and more 
sustainable freight sector in China. 

SFC China is ZEFI’s Secretariat, setting the agenda and leading discussions among stakeholders. SFC China 
has been instrumental in organizing workshops, conferences, and meetings to facilitate knowledge sharing 
and  consensus-building  on  key  topics  such  as  charging  infrastructure  development,  financing  models,  and 
policy incentives for zero-emission trucks.  They have also developed and published several reports on zero-
emission freight, providing valuable data and analysis to inform decision-making. 

Beyond  its  role  in  ZEFI,  SFC  China  has  been  actively  involved  in  various  zero-emission  freight  corridor 
projects, including the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Zero-Emission Freight Demonstration Project. This project, 
launched in 2022, has successfully deployed over 400 new energy vehicles and established 8 zero-emission 
freight corridors in northern China, showcasing the viability of electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks for freight 
transport.  SFC China played a key role in this project by: 

§  Facilitating stakeholder engagement: They brought together key players from government, industry, 

and academia to create a collaborative ecosystem. 

§  Conducting research and analysis: They analyzed operational data, evaluated different technologies, 

and identified best practices for zero-emission freight corridors. 

§  Developing and disseminating resources: They created toolkits and guidance documents to support 

the replication of the project's successes in other regions. 

The BTH project has achieved significant milestones, including the establishment of 7 hydrogen fuel cell long-
haul corridors, 1 electric vehicle charging long-haul corridor, and 1 battery swapping corridor.  The project's 
Beijing-Tianjin Daily Goods Hydrogen Corridor was even recognized as a "Zero Carbon Pilot Project" by the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ministry of Transport. By developing and sharing toolkits and best practices, ZEFI and SFC China are helping 
to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission freight solutions across China. 

Strategic Approach for Project Development 

Real-world implementation projects have significant value in road freight electrification. Whether for temporary 
vehicle  or  infrastructure  testing  or  towards  scaled  deployment,  having  a  focused  approach  to  project 
development is key. With these caveats in mind, the key areas of strategic value to be derived from this project 
include:  

§  Mobilizing the resources needed to initiate a sector-
wide  transition  within  the  (limited)  scope  of  an 
application  area,  by  funding  vehicles,  infrastructure 
and aggregating demand. 

§  Generating real-world data and learnings to underpin 
implementation design and sectoral transition.  
§  Developing recommendations for the logistics sector, 
solution providers and governments for the scaling of 
similar projects.  

§  Creating  awareness  and  increasing  the  sectoral 
trucks  and  charging 

competence  of  electric 
infrastructure within the logistics sector.

ZEFI's project development approach prioritizes collaboration 
and  real-world  impact  (Figure  1).  It  begins  with  Scoping, 
where stakeholder needs, particularly those of shippers, are 
mapped to define the project's scope and aims. This ensures 
that projects are anchored in addressing practical challenges 
and  meeting  tangible  demands.  The  Partnership  stage  focuses  on  building  a  strong  consortium,  bringing 
together  diverse  stakeholders  like  shippers,  carriers,  and  technology  providers,  to  foster  collaboration  and 
resource  sharing.  The  remaining  stages  (Planning,  Deployment,  Evaluation,  Lessons,  and  Expansion) 
follow  a  cyclical  process  of  designing,  implementing,  assessing,  and  scaling  pilot  projects.  This  iterative 
approach allows for continuous learning and improvement, ensuring that projects effectively address shipper 
needs  and  contribute  to  broader  sectoral  transformation.  (Refer  to  Annex  I  for  a  detailed  outline  of  the 
process).

Regional Developments in China and Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou 

China is demonstrating global leadership in the electrification of road freight. In the first half of 2024, China 
accounted for over 80% of global zero-emission truck sales, with a new sales share of 5.5%. This strong uptake 
of electric trucks is driven by several factors, including government support, rapid technological advancements, 
and increasing awareness of the environmental and economic benefits of electrification. 

China's commitment to electrification is evident in its proactive policies and initiatives. The government has 
implemented various measures to incentivize electric truck production and purchase, such as subsidies, tax 
breaks,  and  preferential  road  access  policies.  Moreover,  China  is  actively  investing  in  research  and 
development to advance battery technology, charging infrastructure, and other essential components of the 
electric vehicle ecosystem. 

Shenzhen,  a  major  economic  and  transportation  hub  in  the  Pearl  River  Delta,  is  at  the  forefront  of  this 
electrification drive. The city's high volume of road freight and its dedication to sustainable development make 
it an ideal location for piloting and scaling electric truck solutions. Shenzhen aims to lead the way in heavy-
duty  vehicle  electrification  by  building  demonstration  projects  and  exploring  suitable  technologies  and 
infrastructure. This will generate valuable lessons that can be applied across China and potentially to other 
countries facing similar challenges.

Regionally,  Shenzhen  has  strong  ambitions, 
aiming  to  electrify  all  road  transport  operating 
within its city. As seen in Figure 3, to-date, more 
than 675,000 private passenger vehicles on the 
road  are  electric.  In  2023,  all  of  Shenzhen's 
buses,  cabs,  and  ride-hailing  vehicles,  as  well 
as  87%  of  the  city’s  sanitation  vehicles  have 
been fully electrified.  

the  city’s 

logistics 
Almost  one  quarter  of 
vehicles, or about 130,000 vehicles, are electric. 
Electric light-duty vehicles make up 30% of the 
light-duty  vehicle  segment,  while  the  electric 
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles make up only 
5% of its segment.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
The Importance of Road Freight in the Shenzhen, Dongguan, Huizhou Region 

Shenzhen  plays  a  pivotal  role  as  an  international  transportation  hub.  Shenzhen  boasts  a  comprehensive 
transportation network connecting sea, land, and air routes, facilitating efficient resource allocation and trade 
both  domestically  and  internationally.  Its  strategic  importance  is  underscored  by  its  designation  as  one  of 
China's 45 national highway hubs and its ranking as the 
fourth busiest container port globally, handling nearly 30 
million containers in 2023.  

the 

robust 

This 
thriving 
infrastructure  supports 
manufacturing  industries  of  Dongguan  and  Huizhou. 
Dongguan,  a  key  production  base 
for  electronics, 
machinery,  clothing,  and  footwear,  relies  heavily  on 
Shenzhen's  port  for  exporting  goods  to  global  markets. 
Similarly,  Huizhou,  a  major  producer  of  electronics  and 
automotive products, depends on efficient transport links 
between its factories and Shenzhen's port for both exports 
and  imports.  With  these  considerations  in  mind,  this 
makes  the  road  freight  sector  crucial  to  continue  the 
movement of goods across the SDH region and beyond.  

Shenzhen has approximately 127,000 heavy-duty trucks in 
operation.  The  majority  of  these  trucks  transport  goods 
within the SDH area. This additionally highlights the area’s 
critical role in regional and global supply chains. Figure 4 
shows  that  90%  of  the  operations  by  medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicles  (MHDV)  registered  in  Shenzhen 
operate within the Guangdong province, and almost 70% operate between Shenzhen and Dongguan.

The  trucks  in  the  city  demonstrate  high  utilization, 
averaging  242  operational  days  per  year.  However, 
there  is  variation  across  truck  types.  Refrigerated 
trucks,  essential  for  transporting  perishable  goods, 
show  the  highest  usage  with  272  operational  days, 
while  dump  trucks,  likely  tied  to  construction  and 
infrastructure projects, have the fewest at 204 days. 
Tractor  trucks  and  rigid  trucks  operate  close  to  250 
days a year.

The daily operational mileage shows a stronger variation across vehicle types. Tractor trucks and refrigerated 
trucks show the highest daily utilization of close to 250 kms driven per day. Rigid trucks run considerably less 
- on average 160 km per day. Special-purpose trucks and dump trucks run only about 100kms per day.  

The operational data and freight activity within the region point to two key conditions necessary for scalable 
truck electrification. The first is operational feasibility. Current electric truck ranges available on the market are 
within the demands of current daily operational mileage for heavy-duty trucks. Second, high transport density 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in  the  region  increases  the  viability  and  attractiveness  of  charging  and  grid  infrastructure  construction  and 
upgrades, as well as other logistic synergies.  

Project Objectives and Vision 

In line with the broader aims of ZEFI to promote the widespread adoption of electric heavy-duty trucks in China, 
the demonstration project in the SDH region aims: 

§  To  investigate  the  critical  factors  necessary  for  the  widespread  adoption  of  electric  heavy-duty 
trucks  in  the  SDH  region.  This  includes  evaluating  policies,  charging  infrastructure,  vehicle 
technology, operational routes, and transportation organization methods. 

§  To conduct a pilot demonstration to validate the feasibility of operating electric heavy-duty trucks 

within the region and to establish a viable zero-emission truck corridor.  

§  To gather practical experience and insights from the pilot project to inform the broader application 

and promotion of electric heavy-duty trucks in the Pearl River Delta and across China.

Partnerships 

To lay a strong foundation for the pilot project, the first step is to take stock of the resources the project will 
have access to, the conditions under which the project will be implemented, and to understand and elicit the 
cooperation  from  key  stakeholders  in  the  ecosystem  (Figure  7).  Developing  a  collaborative  model  that 
engages  this  network  of  key  stakeholders  is  critical  to  the  optimal  deployment  of  the  project.  This  section 
provides further details on each stakeholder’s role in the project’s development process. In total, 40 participants 
across  5  different  stakeholder  groups  participated  in  the  project.  Thus,  demonstrating  the  importance  of 
collaborating effectively across different groups. A full list of project participants can be found in Annex II. A 
summary of stakeholder groups and key actions can be found in Table 1.

Government 

Government  involvement  was  a  key  support  pillar  for  the  project’s  development.  A  strong  commitment  to 
support  the  adoption  of  electric  heavy-duty  trucks  was  demonstrated  through  early  and  continual  active 
engagement  throughout  the  project.  It  was  identified  early-on  the  importance  of  partnering  with  real-world 
projects to be able to better inform policy decisions, roadmaps and charging infrastructure deployment.  

As a starting point, the project team’s initial alignment with key government departments’, such as the Ministry 
of Transport and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, national zero-emission transportation 
goals  helped  to  facilitate  action  in  line  with  government  decarbonization  priorities.  Critical  guidance  on 
technology choices that were in alignment with national roadmaps helped to keep the project scope focused 
to be able to provide tangible results. In addition, connections were facilitated with relevant stakeholders in 
Shenzhen’s logistics industry.  

During  the  project,  government  representatives  maintained  close  communication,  monitoring  progress  and 
gathering  valuable  information  about  the  challenges  encountered  in  promoting  electric  trucks.  Financial 
incentives, such as subsidies for electric vehicles and batteries, were also provided to encourage adoption.  

Looking ahead, the government plans to leverage the project findings to inform policy development, including 
refining the dual credit policy to set realistic targets for OEMs and fleet operators. The findings will also guide 
updates to the national technology roadmap and inform strategic decisions about the placement and type of 
charging infrastructure needed to support the widespread adoption of electric heavy-duty trucks. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shippers 

Shippers, which form the core of ZEFI’s network, are integral to truck electrification on a wide-scale basis. 
Aggregating shipper demand to be able to support scalable deployment of electric heavy-duty trucks is a critical 
part of the project. The shippers that supported the project were multinational companies, such as IKEA, Mars, 
and Walmart, as well as Chinese companies, such as Hsu Fu Chi and JUSDA.  

These companies were willing to participate in the project, and contributed the following: 

§  Shared operational plans and data for electric heavy-duty trucks through the pilot project; 
§  Recommended and introduced carriers to join the project; and, 
§  Suggested pilot routes based on the existing electric heavy-duty models under consideration and a 

set of selection criteria that was put together by the XieLi Innovation Center. 

Having a strong shipper network to access not only facilitated the development of important operational data, 
but also necessary relationships to bring in carriers, provide aggregate estimates for vehicle demand to OEMs 
and inform charging infrastructure providers on key pilot routes. 

Carriers 

Carriers play a key role in truck electrification. They are the ones that will have to adopt the vehicles within 
their operations and put the upfront capital investment on the vehicles themselves. Most carriers involved in 
the  project  were  identified  by  leveraging  the  shipper  network.  Some  though  were  identified  by  vehicle 
manufacturers, dealers and industry associations.   

During the research phase, the project team conducted intensive visits to various carrier sites to understand 
their actual operational conditions, as well as their awareness of and demands for electric heavy-duty trucks. 
(featured  more  in  the  next  section).  More  than  20  companies  were  surveyed,  with  10  companies  currently 
participating in the project.  

Participants of the projects received subsidies for renting the electric trucks. This is essential to reduce the 
investment  needed  for  vehicle  use,  encouraging  more  carriers  to  join  the  pilot  project  and  experience  new 
energy heavy-duty trucks. 

Truck OEMs  

The project team engaged with 15 electric truck OEMs, which included major ones such as China National 
Heavy Duty Truck Group (CNHTC), SAIC Hongyan, Geely, Liuzhou Motor. The first step was to ascertain their 
willingness to participate in the project.  

These companies saw the pilot project as an opportunity to promote new energy products and solutions in the 
Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou area and the Pearl River Delta. They contributed by providing rental subsidies 
to  carriers  during  the  trial  period.  In  addition,  during  the  pilot  project,  the  OEMs  had  the  responsibility  of 
coordinating the vehicle trials. 

Charging Infrastructure Providers 

The project team collaborated with charging infrastructure and battery swapping station providers, such as 
Teld, State Power Investment Corporation, Era Qiji Green Energy Technology, Che Dian Wang. Charging and 
swapping companies are highly focused on the operational plans and route planning for electric heavy-duty 
trucks in the SDH area, which provides important information about their future construction plans for charging 
and swapping stations.  

For the pilot participants, they supported the project team in providing access to the services of the existing 
charging stations available for heavy-duty trucks in the Shenzhen area.

Planning  

The  deployment  planning  stage  aimed  to  understand  carrier  requirements  for  vehicles  and  energy 
infrastructure, based on routes selected for the project. These had to be decided or optimized simultaneously, 
based  on  route  operational  demand,  vehicle  availability  and  capability,  and  the  availability  of  energy 
infrastructure  along  those  routes.  The  basis  for  the  plan  was  informed  through  20  carrier  interviews.  The 
selected carriers were recommended to the project by other shippers. Key aspects of this deployment plan 
can be found in Figure 8.

Carrier Interviews 

To identify suitable carriers for the electric truck pilot project, over 20 logistics and transportation companies 
were  interviewed.  These  interviews  assessed  their  operational  needs  and  capabilities,  including  existing 
vehicle conditions, typical routes, energy consumption, and awareness of electric truck technology.  Carriers 
who expressed a clear interest in participating and whose operations aligned with the available electric trucks 
and charging infrastructure were then asked to provide detailed information on their routes. This information, 
along with an evaluation of current electric truck technology, informed the development of the initial pilot project 
plan. 

Route Identification 

This pilot project involved a diverse range of participants and transportation scenarios. A total of 40 companies 
participated, utilizing both 4x2 and 6x4 electric heavy-duty tractors. These trucks were used for various short- 
and  medium-distance  transportation  needs  within  the  SDH  region  and  the  surrounding  Pearl  River  Delta 
(Figure 9). Cargo types included general goods, sand and gravel, hazardous materials, and refrigerated food, 
with  loads  ranging  from  8  to  30  tonnes.  The  trucks  operated  between  ports,  factories,  and  warehouses, 
covering an average daily distance of under 300 kilometers.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Overview of routes tested in the pilots 

The operational profiles of the heavy-duty trucks were then categorized into three major groups: 

§  Port collection and distribution 
§  Short distance factory shuttle 
§  Short distance bulk shuttle 

The  typical  annual  mileage  of  the  trucks  used  on  these  routes  varies,  not  only  depending  on  the  type  of 
operation but also according to the carriers operating the routes. An overview of the operations selected for 
the pilot are presented in Table 2.

Matching the Right Electric Models with Participating Companies 

The  pilot  project  carefully  matched  electric  truck  models  and  battery  capacities  to  the  specific  operational 
needs of participating companies (Table 3). This involved considering factors like daily mileage, typical routes, 
and  cargo  weight.  The  selected  models  included  4x2  and  6x4  pure  electric  tractors  with  varying  battery 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capacities (141 kWh, 282 kWh, or 350 kWh), equipped with both charging and battery swapping capabilities. 
These specifications were chosen to effectively meet the diverse logistics and transportation demands within 
the SDH region and the broader Pearl River Delta.

Charging Infrastructure 

To optimize charging station operations to best meet the needs of electric trucks, they were first screened 
based  on  specific  criteria.  This  included  the  charging  power  (i.e.  rated  power  output  kW),  accessibility  for 
heavy-duty vehicles in terms of vehicle dimensions, and operating hours.  

The next set of criteria assessed the strategic location of the chosen charging stations. The locations were 
chosen based on the specific routes and operational patterns of the pilot participants. Locations were selected 
based on factors such as route starting points, transit points and parking locations.  

Carriers were involved in on-site inspections and continued communication with the station operators to ensure 
compatibility  and  to  address  any  operational  concerns.  The  distribution  of  these  bus  charging  stations  is 
presented in Figure 11. Most of these stations are concentrated in the Shenzhen and Dongguan cities. 

The pilot project ultimately incorporated three energy replenishment modes: 
§  Bus charging stations: Operators of bus charging stations were approached to request for access during 

the pilot. 

§  Private  depot  charging  stations:  Some  of  the  operators  had  charging  stations  intended  for  light  duty 
vehicles. The project investigated whether the sites were suitable for the trucks running in the pilot (Figure 
10). 

§  Truck battery swapping stations: Yunfu Junpeng provided a battery swapping station for use in the pilot 

(Figure 12).

Deployment 

The deployment stage marked the transition from planning to action. It involved deploying electric trucks in 
real-world  freight  operations  and  closely  monitoring  their  performance,  along  with  the  supporting  charging 
infrastructure. This hands-on experience provided valuable data and insights into the practicalities of electric 
truck  adoption,  informing  the  evaluation  of  their  performance  and  generating  lessons  learned  for  future 
applications. 

Execution 

the  project 

To ensure the smooth operation of the pilot project, a coordinated vehicle delivery and carrier training process 
was implemented (Figure 13). 
First, 
team  worked  closely  with 
participating  vehicle  manufacturers  to  confirm  truck 
availability  and  delivery  schedules.  This  involved 
facilitating  agreements  between  manufacturers  and 
carriers for the use of 38 electric heavy-duty trucks, 
ultimately operated by 10 different carrier companies. 
Before 
training 
programs  were  conducted  by  the  manufacturers  to 
familiarize  drivers  with 
the  operation  and 
maintenance  of  electric  trucks.  To  further  support 
smooth operations, manufacturers provided ongoing 
technical  support  and  arranged  for  personnel  to 
monitor  vehicle  conditions  and  address  any  issues 
the  safe  and  reliable 
promptly.  This  ensured 
performance of the electric trucks throughout the pilot 
project.

comprehensive 

deployment, 

After  deployment,  the  drivers  were  also  interviewed  about  their  driving  experience  to  understand  the 
advantages and disadvantages of the electric truck from the drivers’ perspective.  

Monitoring 

To ensure the collection of robust and reliable data during the pilot project, a comprehensive data collection 
strategy was implemented. This involved gathering two types of data: 

§  Transport data: This included information about the vehicles used, the routes they traveled, and the weight 

of the cargo being transported; and, 

§  Vehicle and energy data: This focused on the operational performance of the electric trucks, including 

distance traveled and electricity consumption. 

Clear communication and coordination were essential to the success of this data collection effort. The project 
team worked closely with vehicle manufacturers to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the vehicle and 
energy  data.  They  also  communicated  with  carriers,  providing  them  with  templates  and  instructions  for 
recording essential transport data, and followed up monthly to ensure data quality. 

The  project  team  successfully  coordinated  283  vehicle  months  for  the  pilot  schedule.  From  this  the  team 
collected 142 vehicle months of operational and monitoring data, with over 400,000 km driven by a fleet of 38 
electric trucks. This valuable dataset will be used to analyze the performance of the electric trucks, assess 
their suitability for various transportation tasks, and evaluate their economic and environmental benefits. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evaluation 

The data collected from the real-world operational testing of the electric trucks will be used to evaluate their 
performance  across  three  key  dimensions:  operational  suitability,  financial  viability,  and  greenhouse  gas 
emission benefits. 

Operational Suitability 

The pilot project demonstrated that electric trucks are well-suited to meet the operational demands of the SDH 
region.  

As a major economic hub with established transportation routes, it offers a stable operating environment with 
high logistics demand. The region's focus on lighter cargo (15-20 tonnes) aligns well with the capabilities of 
current electric trucks, minimizing concerns about overloading or underutilization.  

Furthermore, most heavy-duty trucks in the SDH area operate within a daily range of less than 300 km, mainly 
on urban roads, making them well-suited to the range and performance of current electric truck and charging 
technology. The pilot project also successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a combined fast charging 
and battery swapping model, balancing transportation efficiency with cost-effectiveness. 

The project identified over 130 charging stations suitable for heavy-duty electric trucks in the SDH region and 
the surrounding areas. These stations are strategically located in logistics hubs, parking lots, and bus depots, 
thus offering convenient access for charging and battery swapping. The availability of high-power charging 
infrastructure at these locations ensured efficient charging and minimized downtime for the electric trucks. 

Overall, the operational suitability analysis indicates that electric trucks are a viable and effective solution for 
meeting  the  freight  transportation  needs  of  the  SDH  region.  The  alignment  of  transport  demand,  vehicle 
capabilities,  and  charging  infrastructure  creates  a  favorable  environment  for  the  wider  adoption  of  electric 
trucks. Vehicle and operating data collected during the pilot can be seen in Table 4.

The energy consumption rate based on the measured data of the pilots showed variability within operation 
types, as well as vehicle brands, when used in multiple operations. In particular, across the three categories: 

§  Port collection and distribution: the energy consumption rate ranged from 1.06 to 1.61 kWh/km, whereas 

its diesel consumption rate ranged from 0.25 to 0.30 liter/km.  

§  Short distance factory shuttle: the energy consumption rate ranged from 1.34 to 1.61 kWh/km, whereas its 

diesel consumption rate ranged from 0.30 to 0.50 liter/km. 

§  Short distance bulk shuttle: the energy consumption rate ranged from 1.36 to 1.73 kWh/km, whereas its 

diesel consumption rate ranged from 0.30 to 0.50 liter/km.

Figure 14. 5-year TCO comparison of diesel and electric vehicles 

When analyzing the TCO results, some conclusions can be made. First, the TCO of electric vehicles for port 
collection and distribution as well as short distance factory shuttle operations was higher than diesel’s TCO – 
but varied significantly from scenario to scenario. While both scenario 1 and scenario 6 came close to TCO 
parity, scenarios 2, 3, 5 and 8 had TCO gaps of 20% or more.  

Second,  the  TCO  gaps  for  both  scenarios  in  the  short  distance  bulk  shuttles  were  significantly  in  favor  of 
electric  vehicles.  Each  vehicle  was  intensively  used  and  therefore  made  use  of  the  advantageous  lower 
operating  costs  compared  to  diesel  vehicles.  This  may  enable  operators  to  recuperate  the  costs  of  their 
investments more quickly.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental Benefits  

The evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions savings showed significant potential for emissions reductions of 
a transport operation (Figure 15). The emissions for each scenario were calculated based on the principles of 
the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting V3.0 
(GLEC  3.0)  and  ISO14083.  The  emission-related  default  factors  were  based  on  the  GLEC  Framework  3.0 
China Default Emission Factors v1.0, and local conditions were considered for selection or estimation.  

In total, 256 tonnes of CO2 were generated during the pilot due to electricity production. Avoided emissions 
from the substitution of diesel with electricity were at least 253 tonnes of CO2.

The  emissions  intensity  reduction  potential  varied  according  to  the  operation  category.  In  most  cases,  an 
emission  intensity  reduction  of  25%  was  reached.  Only  scenarios  2  and  5  had  an  uncharacteristically  low 
reduction potential.

Conclusions 

Based  on  individual  scenarios  and  operational  conditions,  it  is  evidently  clear  that  there  are  significant 
variations in financial viability and emissions savings. Generally speaking, scenarios with higher total distances 
tended to have more lucrative TCO analysis in comparison to their diesel equivalents compared to shorter total 
distances. Of note, scenarios 9 and 10, with a particularly high total distance travelled had the most attractive 
TCO. When coupling intensity in kWh/km (translating to a higher cost of electricity per km), TCO that had low 
total distances with high energy intensities have less attractive TCO. For example, scenarios 2, 7 and 8.  

In that same vein, higher amounts of displaced diesel equated to better overall emissions benefits due to the 
lower overall carbon intensity of electricity. Naturally, as the carbon intensity of China’s electrical grid continues 
to decline, these emissions savings would only increase over time.  

Overall, electric trucks demonstrated operational suitability for the routes chosen within the pilot. Due to most 
travel falling within a 300 km daily range, it was well within the current battery electric ranges offered by different 

1 Emissions factors for China’s electrical grid were provided in CO2 units only. Other pollutants such as NOx, SOx and CO were not included. Hence, to make 
the same unit comparisons, avoided emissions are also calculated in CO2 units only, with the caveat that if including other pollutants, the emissions 
savings would be greater. 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
models  and  the  available  density  of  charging  infrastructure.  Considerations  were  also  made  between  fast 
charging and battery swapping stations when balancing cost effectiveness with convenience.  

 
 
 
Lessons Learned 

Real-world deployment of electric trucks in the SDH pilot project provided valuable insights and highlighted 
key challenges. These lessons learned are crucial for informing future electric truck projects and optimizing 
implementation strategies. 

Specific Challenges and Solutions Encountered During Deployment 

Real-world project deployment provided key insights into the operational and economic reality of the transition 
to electric. Challenges faced at the time of the project included: 

§  Lack of familiarity with electric trucks and technology: Many transportation companies lack an accurate 
understanding  of  key  concepts  like  "battery  capacity,"  "charging,"  and  "battery  swapping."  This  lack  of 
knowledge made it difficult for them to purchase models that were accurately aligned with their operational 
needs.  

§  Lack  of  infrastructure  to  support  operations:  While  an  effort  was  made  to  ensure  a  comprehensive 
charging  network  would  be  developed,  many  scenarios  still  required  significant  detours  for  recharging, 
which reduced operational efficiency. The network of charging facilities was found to not be dense enough 
to support the operational demands of the electric trucks.  

§  Unsuitable  dimensions  of  charging  stations:  For  trucks  with  a  total  length  exceeding  17  meters 
(including  the  tractor  and  trailer),  the  challenge  of  charging  at  stations  was  prominent.  Most  locations 
required the trailer to be detached before entering the station for charging. 

§  Unfavorable electric truck economic conditions: In the SDH region, the annual mileage for trucks was 
generally low, and the per-kilometer cost difference between electric and fuel vehicles was minimal. In its 
current  operational  conditions  this  made  it  difficult  for  electric  trucks  to  demonstrate  a  clear  economic 
advantage over diesel vehicles. 

These challenges are typical in the early stages of electric truck adoption and are expected to diminish as the 
vehicle and charging infrastructure markets mature. However, the pilot project demonstrates that carriers can 
already leverage the capabilities of current electric truck models and available charging infrastructure.  

Based on the collective experience of the project participants, the following recommendations are offered to 
support wider deployment in the current market.  

§ 

Increase  the  opportunity  for  fleet  operator  vehicle  testing:  To  bridge  the  gap  between  industry’s 
familiarity with the technology, optimal operating conditions and ways to optimize the business case, the 
sector  can  provide  more  opportunities  for  vehicle  trials.  One  option  is  for  manufacturers  to  offer  fleet 
operators opportunities to test vehicles and extend the trial should further testing be required.  This would 
allow companies to fully understand the actual performance of the vehicles and how it can align with their 
day-to-day operations. 

§  Use vehicles with battery capacity over 350 kWh in future trials: This would ensure a fully charged 
range of over 200 km.  A larger battery would also reduce current limitations around insufficient range and 
an underdeveloped charging infrastructure network.  

§  Create a charging infrastructure strategy: More specifically identify suitable charging or battery swap 
stations for different scenarios and use causes to improve infrastructure access and truck operation along 
routes.  

§  Create fit-for-purpose charging infrastructure: Build small bay-type battery swap stations or high-power 

fast charging stations to meet the energy needs of large trucks in urban areas.  

§  Support a sector-wide charging infrastructure strategy: Foster collaboration between the government 
and industry to redesign and build a dedicated charging and battery swap service network for electric trucks. 
The model should adopt a hybrid of large, centralized stations and smaller distributed ones, and combine 
charging and battery swapping stations in one area to address insufficient energy infrastructure. 
Identify  TCO-optimal  conditions  for  the  operations:  Assess  the  routes  to  allow  the  consortium  to 
prioritize piloting electric heavy trucks on routes with high operational demand and sufficient mileage. This 

§ 

 
 
 
 
 
 
would preferably use charging instead of battery swapping, due to better economics. Nighttime charging 
should be prioritized to reduce energy costs. 

Conditions for Project Development Success 

Based on SFC’s approach to the development of electric truck deployment projects and the project team’s 
experience in the SDH region, the team has identified several key success factors for each stage in the project. 
A key aspect of the project’s success highlights the importance of collaboration amongst different stakeholders 
to optimize operating conditions.  

Scoping and Partnerships

Expansion 

The deployment of electric trucks in the SDH region is expected to be the first step in the planned electrification 
of road freight in Shenzhen. The experience gained throughout the project highlights not only the challenges 
that still lay ahead in scaling up the adoption of electric trucks, but also the opportunities. In light of this planned 
expansion,  the  project  team  has  highlighted  two  strategic  actions  to  shape  the  next  phase  of  work  which 
include: 

§  Extension of deployment projects towards corridor electrification. 
§  Measures for industry-wide collaboration. 

Extension of Deployment Projects Towards Corridor Electrification 

Understanding  the  distribution  of  logistics  operations  in  Shenzhen  is  crucial  for  analyzing  the  potential  for 
electric heavy-duty truck adoption. Shenzhen boasts a comprehensive logistics network, including 6 logistics 
parks, 22 highway freight hubs, 31 express sorting centers and 11 supermarket distribution centers, covering 
a  total  area  of  34  km2.  These  facilities  are  strategically  located,  with  logistics  parks  concentrated  around 
comprehensive transportation hubs such as ports, airports, and railways (Figure 16).

Logistics Hub Layout Plan (2021-2035) 

When analyzing truck activity heatmaps in the Shenzhen area it reveals a clear pattern (Figure 17). Truck 
operations are largely centered around logistic hubs, with the highest activity concentrated within those 
areas. Key freight corridors, including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Highway, Nanping Expressway, Longda 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Expressway, Yanpai Expressway, and the Pearl River Delta Ring Road, also experience significant truck 
traffic. This highlights the importance of prioritizing these areas for future electrification efforts. Logistics 
stations and freight corridors surrounding key logistics nodes should be the focus of both vehicle deployment 
and energy infrastructure planning. This includes the development of zero-emission freight corridors, which 
should be strategically designed around these high-activity nodes and transportation channels.

Vehicle Monitoring Platform) 

Goals of a Shenzhen - Freight Corridor Pilot 

Considering  where  freight  vehicle  operations  are  concentrated  in  Shenzhen,  the  next  step  is  to  identify 
objectives to the expansion of a pilot project within this area. The development of a follow-up zero-emission 
freight  corridor  pilot  with  Shenzhen  as  its  focal  city  would  be  guided  by  the  following  objectives.  These 
objectives are: 

§  Building a zero-emission freight corridor along a strategic network:  

–  Focus:  Identify  and  deploy  typical  application  scenarios  that  align  with  Shenzhen's  equipment 

performance and transportation needs.  

–  Scope:  Towards  the  development  of  Shenzhen’s  "Four  Vertical  and  Two  Horizontal"  zero-emission 
freight corridor network, covering major cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. 

§  Deploying multiple zero-carbon fleets at scale:  

–  Timeline: Within a year of corridor initiation, establish more than 5 heavy-duty road freight "zero-carbon 

fleets" across at least two application scenarios.  

–  Scale: Deploy, at least, 200 new pilot vehicles for these fleets. 
Installing sufficient infrastructure:  

§ 

–  Goal: Install sufficient infrastructure based on the future needs of the corridor. 
–  Type: Construct a batch of charging and battery-swapping stations and other supporting infrastructure.  

With these objectives in mind, identifying geographic areas for corridor development will be important. The 
following corridors highlighted below have been identified for further exploration in the Shenzhen area.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Shenzhen-Hong Kong Cross-Border 
Fresh Produce Zero-Emission Freight 
Corridor 

The next deployment project that has 
been identified will connect the Pinghu 
Haijixing Vegetable Wholesale Market 
and Qingshuihe warehouse in Shenzhen 
with the Chang Sha Wan Wholesale 
Vegetable Market and Sheung Shui in 
Hong Kong. The one-way distance is 
approximately 70 km. This corridor will 
primarily use pure electric medium and 
heavy-duty trucks (Figure 18). 

East Port Zero-Emission Freight 
Corridor 

The corridor connects the Eastern Port 
Area of cargo sources in Shenzhen, 
Dongguan, Guangzhou with cities on the 
western side of the Pearl River Delta 
(Figure 19). The maximum one-way 
transport distance is 200 km. The 
proposed vehicle types mainly include 
4x2 or 6x4 electric tractor-trailers, with a 
focus on battery-swapping technology.

Future Expansion of Zero-Emission 
Freight Corridors 

Once the two sides of the corridor are 
completed, the following extensions 
would be carried out to ensure a 
comprehensive and well-connected 
electrified network (Figure 20):

Measures for Industry-Wide Electrification 

To further accelerate the adoption of electric heavy-duty trucks and to ensure the success of the zero-emission 
freight  corridor  initiative,  a  multi-faceted  approach  encompassing  enhanced  support  measures,  regional 
collaboration, priority access policies, and innovative incentives is crucial. 

Enhancing Support Measures 

Three support measures in the vehicle ecosystem are needed: 

§  First,  accelerating  the  deployment  of  charging  and  battery  swapping  infrastructure  is  essential.  This 
involves  strategically  building  these  facilities  in  the  core  areas  of  the  freight  corridor  and  surrounding 
regions, ensuring convenient and reliable energy replenishment for electric trucks.  

§  Next, establishing a comprehensive after-sales system with maintenance service points and emergency 
response mechanisms along the corridor will further support the operation of these vehicles, and ensure 
high vehicle uptime.  

§  Finally,  strong  coordination  with  relevant  stakeholders,  such  as  the  Shenzhen  Logistics  Center  Leading 
Group, and government departments of Development and Reform, Industry and Information Technology, 
Transportation, Science and Technology, Energy, Market Regulation, and Finance, is needed to optimize 
trial conditions, address challenges, and incentivize the use of electric trucks. 

Strengthening Regional Collaboration 
Expanding  the  initiative  requires  strong  regional  collaboration.  This  includes  securing  additional  outbound 
vehicle  quotas  specifically  for  zero-emission  trucks  operating  from  Shenzhen  to  Hong  Kong  and  Macau. 
Streamlining procedures for certification, driver licensing, and emergency charging in the Hong Kong section 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the corridor will further facilitate cross-border operations. The trials could also explore the use of adapters 
for different charging standards (e.g., China or EU standards).  
In addition, civil organizations in Shenzhen and Hong Kong could be coordinated towards fostering greater 
interoperability and industry consensus on the development of electric heavy-duty trucks in the Greater Bay 
Area. 

Priority Road Access Policy 
Granting priority road access to electric trucks is crucial for promoting their adoption. This involves relaxing 
road  access  restrictions  and  allowing  electric  trucks  to  operate  freely  within  the  pilot  areas,  regardless  of 
existing  traffic  limitations.  Implementing  green  channel  policies  at  ports,  terminals,  and  logistics  parks  will 
prioritize  access  and  expedite  loading  and  unloading  for  electric  trucks.  This,  coupled  with  measures  like 
electronic toll collection (ETC), would improve the operational efficiency of electric trucks and incentivize their 
use. 

Innovative Financial Support Measures 

Innovative  financing  models,  such  as  the  "battery  as  a  service"  model  for  trucks  with  battery  swapping 
capabilities, can further encourage adoption. This approach, combined with specialized financial solutions and 
tailored  insurance  products  can  reduce  upfront  costs  and  make  electric  trucks  more  accessible  to  fleet 
operators.  Other  incentives  like  vehicle  purchase  subsidies,  toll  reductions,  and  carbon  emission  reduction 
rewards will further incentivize the transition to electric trucks. The government, manufacturers and financial 
institutions could explore how these measures can be implemented.  

Vehicle Promotion Measures 
Supporting the early retirement and replacement of older, polluting trucks with new energy vehicles is essential. 
This  can  be  achieved  by  aligning  with  national  policies  for  scrapping  and  updating  aging  freight  trucks. 
Encouraging  freight  companies  to  prioritize  the  use  of  electric  trucks  during  bidding  processes  will  further 
promote their adoption. Ongoing operational monitoring and analysis, including the measurement of energy 
efficiency and carbon emission reductions according to ISO 14083 standards would provide valuable data to 
support continuous improvement and demonstrate the benefits of electric trucks.
