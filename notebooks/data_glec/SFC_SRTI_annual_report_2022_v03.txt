The Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative

The Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI) is an online platform 
that allows shipowners to publicly disclose their ship recycling policies, 
practice and progress, thereby holding themselves to account before key 
stakeholders – including customers, financial stakeholders, governments, 
NGOs and the wider public. Since 2023, Smart Freight Centre is the host of 
the SRTI.

Through transparency, the SRTI aims to accelerate a market-driven approach to responsible ship 
recycling, enabling lenders, investors, cargo owners, and others to make informed decisions and reward 
good practice.

The SRTI publishes an annual progress report presenting a compilation of the data disclosed on the 
platform by twelve major shipowners, which operate a total of 3665 vessels.

The SRTI is not a performance standard nor a rating exercise, and data on the SRTI online platform is 
neither audited nor verified by any third party for the SRTI. However, this data is open to verification 
directly with the disclosing party by any interested stakeholder. 

This report compiles and presents some of the key data points against which shipowners have disclosed 
their ship recycling policies and practices, aimed to provide an overview of the initiative and the data 
available. Each shipowner’s disclosure can be viewed on the SRTI website.

SRTI Progress Report  2022Our theory of change

SRTI’s theory of change breaks down the 
ways in which openly disclosed, easily 
accessible data can lead to improvements 
in the industry and create a virtuous 
cycle of transparency that rewards good 
practice, demanding and encouraging more 
transparency regarding ship recycling.

The SRTI provides a platform through which shipowners can 
publicly disclose their ship recycling policies, practices and 
progress, thereby holding themselves to account before all 
stakeholders – including customers, investors, governments, 
NGOs, and the wider public. This data, in turn, enables cargo 
owners, financial stakeholders and others to make informed 
decisions and reward good practice through the market, 
raising the bar for the industry.

Shipowners collect and disclose data  
on their ship recycling policies, practices 
and progress, holding themselves to 
account before key stakeholders – including 
customers, investors, governments, NGOs 
and the wider public. Data is updated annually.

SRTI Progress Report  2022Circular economy - Ecosystem Opportunities

The ship recycling industry continues to make strides in aligning with the 
principles of the circular economy, advancing resource efficiency and waste 
reduction. Through responsible dismantling and recycling practices, the industry 
can recovers  valuable materials from end-of-life ships, contributing to play a 
significant role in the race towards a more circular economic model.

Notably, recycling ships yields significant amounts of steel (in 2022 some 11.8 
million metric tons were extracted), reducing the demand for virgin resources and 
providing an excellent and quality-consistent source for the steel manufacturing 
industry. 

The collaboration between ship recycling stakeholders and the steel 
manufacturers can foster a greener and more sustainable steel industry.

As global economy is increasing its efforts towards decarbonization, the steel manufacturing industry is 
increasingly interested into ship recycling as a valuable source of scrap for steel production. In fact, the 
process of recycling a vessel offers an interesting source of quality-consistent steel scrap that could help 
steel manufacturers in reducing their environmental impact and support their journey towards their 
decarbonization goals.

SRTI Progress Report  2022While steel certainly accounts as the biggest index when dismantling a ship, 
additionally, other valuable resources can also be salvaged. This can include:

•  Non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminium;

•  Machinery and equipment

•  Furniture

•  Plastics 

which contributes to decreasing the pressure for raw material extraction. It is 
believed that, if the demolition is conducted properly, it may be possible to re-use 
and recycle a fraction that can exceed 99% of the entire vessel.

Hong Kong Convention Certified yards

In 2022, the ship recycling industry saw an increased amount of yards getting Hong Kong Convention 
Statement of Compliance (SoC) certified , which has consistently increased the safe disposal of hazardous 
materials, the protection of the environment as well as addressing workers’ rights to receive adequate 
training to perform their job in regards to  safety. 

The ship recycling industry plays an important role fostering socio-economic development, employing 
thousands of workers by supporting local communities. Continued collaboration, innovation, and 
adherence to sustainable practices are crucial to further enhancing the industry’s contribution to the 
circular economy, striving for a future of resource efficiency and environmental responsibility.

DEFINITION 

An Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) tracks a number of materials throughout the  
vessel’s operational life and in preparation for recycling. 

It consists of three parts:

•  Part I: Hazardous materials contained in the ship’s structure and equipment

•  Part II: Operationally generated waste

•  Part III: Stores

A certified IHM is required by both the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (currently in force and 
applicable to all EU/EEA flagged vessels and non-EU flagged vessels calling at EU ports),  
and the IMO Hong Kong Convention (not currently in force).

NOTE: Shipowners may cover more than one vessel type

Number of vessels owned and chartered

Shipowners disclose data against a pre-determined set of questions across five topics:

•  policy and standards; 
•  selling owned vessels; 
•  ship recycling contracts;
•  inventory of hazardous materials (IHM) and ship recycling documentation; and
•  policy and standard implementation. 

Shipowners are prompted to review and update their data once per year.

12

SRTI Progress Report  2022International conventions and principles to which ship recycling policies adhere

Ship recycling policy and standards

The first section of the SRTI disclosure aims to get an overview of the policies 
and standards the shipowner adheres to, including international legislation and 
conventions, restrictions based on recycling method and/or geography, and 
policies for selecting a yard or buyer for recycling. 

DEFINITION 

Policy: A statement of intent on the approach taken to ship recycling.

Standard: An internal agreed document against which compliance can  
be measured.

Source: SRTI disclosure questionnaire

Disclosing shipowners’ policies adhere to a range of global and regional international conventions, 
guidelines and principles of relevance to ship recycling. These include:

•  Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal

•  EU Ship Recycling Regulation

•  Hong Kong Convention for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships

•  ISO 30000:2009 Ships and marine technology – Ship recycling management systems

•  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

•  Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants

•  The Recycling of Ships Act

•  United Nations Global Compact

•  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

13

SRTI Progress Report  2022Topics covered by ship recycling policy

All 14 shipowners

disclosing their data via the SRTI have a written policy on 
ship recycling for their own vessels, and nine shipowners 
make the policy document public. To varying degrees,  
8 of those disclosing place restrictions for yard selection 
based on recycling method or geography, for example 
only recycling in yards where blocks are prevented from 
falling in the intertidal zone.

11 shipowners

also have written policies for 
selecting a buyer or ship recycling 
facility, which may require, for 
example, a class-approved Hong 
Kong Convention Statement of 
Compliance, or auditing and onsite 
visits as part of the vetting process.

“Sustainable ship recycling can provide benefits to both the global environment and local communities. 

But this is contingent on having strong governance and trasparency recycling practices in place. Without 

such the industry quickly risks doing more harm than good. Seaspan looks forward to working with SRTI 

to promote responsible and safe ship recycling practices.” 

Torsten Holst Pedersen 
CEO, Seaspan Corporation

shipowners

disclosing data via the SRTI have a policy to promote 
responsible recycling of owned vessels sold for further 
trading, and 10 out of 12 impose legally binding 
covenants or offer commercial incentives to the buyer 
to encourage responsible recycling.

Provisions outlined in some current SRTI disclosures 
include a requirement that the vessel operates for a 
minimum of 24 months after purchase, and, in cases 
where the vessel’s selling price is less than 25% higher 
than the current scrap value, a clause may be included 
stipulating adherence to specific ship recycling 
requirements or policies. 

Policy for selling owned vessels for further 
trading

Based on the vessel category, ships are commonly resold at 
least once throughout their operational lifespan. This can 
be attributed to the need for more modern, environmentally 
friendly ships aligning with companies’ efforts to reduce 
carbon emissions and update their fleet. In such instances, 
ship owners might encourage responsible disposal of the 
ship or ships by implementing enforceable agreements or 
providing economic benefits to support environmentally 
responsible recycling when the vessel reaches the end of its 
life.

The trend observed in the provided policy excerpts revolves 
around promoting sustainable ship recycling practices and 
compliance with international conventions.The policies 
emphasize the inclusion of clauses in vessel sale agreements 
that require compliance with Ship Recycling Facilities 
standards outlined in the Hong Kong Convention. They also 
address different scenarios based on selling prices, residual 
values, and guarantees for trading or recycling ships for a 
minimum period.

The policies highlight the importance of not recycling 
vessels within a specific timeframe (typically 24 months) and 
complying with applicable regulations. Overall, disclosed 
policies aim to ensure responsible and sustainable practices 
in vessel recycling, considering factors such as selling 
prices, residual values, and compliance with international 
conventions and regulations.

DEFINITION 

The scrap value is the price at which the vessel 
could be sold for recycling. This value is primarily 
informed by the scrap steel price as the vessel will be 
dismantled and the steel sold for reuse,  
re-rolling or melting.

Joint venturing appears to be another interesting 
practice within signatories’ disclosed practices. Joint 
ventures can in fact promote a more responsible ship 
recycling process, facilitating the exchange of knowledge, 
resources, and best practices, leading to improved 
transparency, safety measures, and compliance with 
international standards.

By pooling expertise and sharing responsibilities, these 
partnerships contribute to a more sustainable and 
ethical ship recycling industry, ultimately minimizing the 
environmental impact and safeguarding the welfare of 
workers involved in the process.

All

shipowners

provide the buyer or recycler with 
a class approved IHM, as well as 
all relevant certificates, plans, 
procedures and documents in 
line with the shipowners’ policies 
and standards.

Ship recycling contract

The following three sections focus on the process of 
preparing to recycle a vessel and the recycling process. 

A ship recycling contract is the contract for the sale of a 
ship for the purpose of recycling. While some companies 
may use industry contract templates, such as BIMCO’s 
RECYCLECON, others prefer to develop their own. Regardless 
of the approach, the contract might entail provisions such 
as mandating the recycling of the vessel at a designated 
facility or stipulating the need for access to the yard during 
the recycling process to facilitate monitoring and auditing 
activities.

Inventory of hazardous materials (IHM) and ship 
recycling documentation

The Hong Kong Convention requires the presence on board 
of an Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) for every 
merchant ship above 500 gross tonnage. The IHM specifies 
what is classified as hazardous material, and contains 
mandatory requirements concerning the installation and 
treatment of these hazardous materials on board that is 
specific to that ship.

While not yet in force, the majority of shipowners and ship 
recycling facilities adhere to the Convention’s requirements.

Ship recycling documentation, in turn, includes the 
documentation provided by the shipowner to the buyer or 
ship recycling facility, including relevant certificates, plans, 
procedures and documents.

“Continuing the SRTI membership 

under our new brand name was a 

matter of course. We want to take  

a leading position in the change 

we all need to be a part of, and we 

believe openness and transparency 

are key in achieving this.”

SRTI Progress Report  2022Implementation of the ship recycling policy and standard

The concluding part of the disclosure questionnaire centers on the execution 
of ship recycling policies and standards throughout the recycling procedure. 
Shipowners may necessitate entry to the ship recycling facility before, during, and 
after the recycling process for the purpose of conducting audits and monitoring. 

Moreover, shipowners may request the application of criteria on the facility 
that align with their own policies and standards, such as mandating grievance 
mechanisms for workers or ensuring the right to collective bargaining.

Insurance - role of insurers in responsible ship recycling

Authors: Swiss Re, Hellenic Hull Management and Gard.

The shipping industry has been making notable strides 
towards responsible ship recycling practices, driven 
by growing environmental and social concerns. In this 
pursuit, the role of insurers has emerged as a vital 
component in promoting responsible ship recycling. 
As key stakeholders, insurers can use their leverage to 
shape industry practices by encouraging sustainable 
behaviour and mitigating risks associated with 
irresponsible ship recycling.

Promoting Responsible Practices

Insurers can play a role in promoting responsible ship 
recycling practices by integrating environmental and 
social criteria into their underwriting decisions. By 
assessing a shipowner’s commitment to responsible 
recycling and adherence to international standards, 
insurers can promote environmentally and socially 
responsible practices. Encouraging shipowners to 
choose recycling facilities that prioritize worker 
safety, environmental protection, and transparency 
contributes to transforming the ship recycling industry 
as a whole.

Risk Mitigation

Promoting Compliance

Insurers have a vested interest in mitigating risks associated 
with ship recycling. By actively promoting responsible ship 
recycling initiatives, insurers can help prevent potential 
losses and reputational damage. Through comprehensive 
due diligence and collaboration with shipowners, Insurers 
can communicate clear expectations and requirements for 
responsible ship recycling practices for shipowners to reduce 
the likelihood of accidents, legal liabilities, and negative 
environmental impact.

Driving Industry Collaboration

Insurers have the unique ability to drive collaboration across 
the ship recycling ecosystem. By partnering with industry 
associations, regulatory bodies, and shipowners, insurers 
can encourage collective action towards responsible ship 
recycling practices. Such collaborative efforts foster a culture 
of transparency and accountability, propelling the industry 
towards more sustainable practices.

Insurers can use their influence to promote and motivate 
shipowners to select reputable ship recycling facilities 
complying with responsible ship recycling standards, 
invest in worker safety, and adopt environmentally sound 
practices, thus creating a virtuous cycle that benefits both 
the industry and the environment.

Insurers can play a vital role in fostering responsible 
ship recycling practices. Through their underwriting 
decisions, risk mitigation strategies, and collaborative 
efforts, insurers can contribute to shape the industry’s 
future. By promoting responsible behaviours, insurers can 
drive positive change, improve worker safety, protect the 
environment, and contribute to the overall sustainability 
of the shipping industry

19

SRTI Progress Report  2022Future priorities

The coming decades will see ship recycling play a pivotal role as the shipping 
industry sets out to achieve its decarbonisation goals and shipowners 
execute their fleet transition plans, recycling older vessels. At the same 
time, growing momentum toward a sustainable shipping industry will bring 
increased pressure for shipowners, from customers, investors, and others, to 
report and take action on environmental, social, and governance issues.

Increased transparency drives awareness, and increased awareness drives action. Stakeholders who 
consider ship recycling to be a material sustainability issue can act – by demanding more transparency, 
asking or requiring stakeholders to join the initiative, and by incorporating the data into their decision-
making processes.

Next steps

After 5 years of successful management by the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, as 
of 2023, the SRTI will be hosted by Smart Freight Centre (SFC), an international 
non-profit organization focused on reducing greenhouse gas emission from freight 
transportation. 

SFC’s goal is to guide the global logistics industry to track and reduce its GHG 
emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 and reach zero emissions by 2050 
or earlier. SFC collaborates with global partners to quantify impacts, identify 
solutions, and advocate logistics decarbonization strategies. 

SRTI and SFC will continue to collaborate to work towards a more transparent, 
responsible and sustainable shipping industry. Synergies between the 
organizations include an overlap in members/signatories as well as competencies 
– with SFC already having experience of hosting Clean Cargo and other data-driven 
initiatives. 

Smart Freight Centre as host is closely linked to the shipping sectors and the multi- 
stakeholder approach needed to tackle these big sustainability challenges, as well 
as the benefits of data and transparency for those stakeholders looking to clearly 
show their commitment to leadership and taking responsibility.
