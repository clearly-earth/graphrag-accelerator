1. Introduction  

1.1. This is an informative document, which summarizes how the MBM Specification (SFC-
SPEC-001-02) compares to Smart Freight Centre´s Voluntary Market Based Measures 
Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting (MBM Framework, v.1.0, 
October 2023). It was prepared to support those who are already familiar with the MBM 
Framework  in  identifying  the  topics  where  the  MBM  Specification  contains  clearer 
definitions, supplementary notes and additional requirements.  

1.2. This document becomes effective on the date of issue indicated above. 

2. Key 

2.1. The following key applies to the colours used in the table below. The word “requirement” 
is mentioned in inverted commas because the MBM Framework does not really contain 
requirements, given it is a guidance - not normative - document. 

No change 
Clarification  
Existing “requirements” expanded 
Existing “requirements” reduced  
“Requirement” added 
“Requirement” removed 

3. References 

2.2. The following documents are referred to in this crosswalk. For dated references, only the 
edition  cited  applies.  For  undated  references,  the  latest  edition  of  the  referenced 
document (including any amendments) applies.  
a)  ISO  14083:2023  -  Greenhouse  gases  - Quantification  and reporting  of greenhouse 

gas emissions arising from transport chain operations   

b)  Voluntary  Market  Based  Measures  Framework  for  Logistics  Emissions  Accounting 

and Reporting, 2023   

c)  ISO14064-1:2018  -  Greenhouse  gases  -  Part  1:  Specification  with  guidance  at  the 
organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals
